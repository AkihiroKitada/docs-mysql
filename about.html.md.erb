This topic describes the architecture for on-demand MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

For information about architecture of the older, pre-provisioned service, see the [Architecture](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-9/architecture.html) topic for MySQL for PCF v1.9.

## <a id='on-demand'></a>Default Network and Service Network

Like other on-demand PCF services, on-demand MySQL for PCF relies on the BOSH 2.0 ability to dynamically deploy VMs in a dedicated network. 
The on-demand service broker uses this capability to create single-tenant service instances in a dedicated service network.
