This topic provides instructions to operators about how to prepare foundations for multi-foundation 
replication using MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

<!-- IS THE TRUE: If you use active-active typology, you must create two primary foundations. -->

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before multi-foundation replication can be configure for MySQL for PCF, an operator must 
create and configure two PCF foundations. 
To create and configure PCF foundations for multi-foundation replication, do the following:

1. Determine the multi-foundation topology you want to use. You can use one of the following:
      + **Passive-Active:** Pivotal recommends this topology for most apps. 
      If you use passive-active typology, you must create a primary foundation and a secondary foundation. 
      For more information, see [Active-Passive Topology](./about-multi-found.html#active-passive). 
      + **Active-Active:** Pivotal recommends this topology for apps with critical workloads 
      that require high app uptime. If you use active-active typology, you must create two primary foundations. 
      For more information, see [Active-Active Topology](./about-multi-found.html#active-active). 

1. Create two PCF foundations with identical release versions. The foundations should also have as similar as possible configurations and capacity. 

1. Configure a global DNS load balancer to point to the two PCF foundations and their local load balancers. See [Configure Your GLB](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/plan/global-dns-lb.html#configure-glb).

##<a id='workflow'></a> Workflow

After two PCF foundations are created, you can enable multi-foundation replication by 
doing the following:

1. A operator [DOES THINGS]. See [Required Networking Rules for Multi-Foundation Replication](./about.html#multi-found-ports).

1. A operator [DOES THINGS]. See [Preparing for TLS](./prepare-tls.html).

1. An operator configures a <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan on both foundations. See
[Configure Service Plans](./install-config.html#active).

1. A developer creates and configures <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances in both foundations. 
See [Using MySQL for PCF](./use.html) 
and [Using MySQL for PCF across Multiple Foundations](./use-multi-found.html).
