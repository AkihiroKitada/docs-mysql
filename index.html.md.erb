This guide describes setting up and using MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) as an on-demand service.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
This documents MySQL for PCF v2.1, an on-demand service that creates dedicated, single-tenant service instances dynamically. For the older, pre-provisioned service, see the v1.10 documentation <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-9">here</a> or select <strong>v1.10</strong> from the dropdown above.</p>

## <a id='AboutTile'></a>About MySQL for PCF

MySQL for PCF enables PCF app developers to provision and use a MySQL database with a
single command.

MySQL for PCF v2 introduces a new type of service, an *on-demand* service. MySQL for PCF v2 offers an alternative to the *pre-provisioned* service
that was in the v1.x series.

This table summarizes the main differences between the two:

   <th>How VMs are created</th>

   <td>New for v2</td>
   <td>Dedicated VM that serves a single service instance</td>
   <td>PCF creates each VM on-demand when app developer creates service instance</td>

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview ##

The MySQL for PCF product delivers dedicated instances on demand, "Database as a Service", to Cloud Foundry users. 
When installed, the tile deploys and maintains a single Service Broker that is responsible for Cloud Foundry integration.
The service is configured with sane defaults, following the principle of least surprise for a general-use relational database service.
