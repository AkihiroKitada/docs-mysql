Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line, then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line. For example, if you use an older v2.5
.x version, upgrade to the latest v2.5.x version before upgrading to the latest v2.6.x version.

## <a id="260"></a> v2.6.0

**Release Date: June 19, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ When upgrading from MySQL for PCF v2.5 to v2.6, internal certificates and
certificate authorities automatically rotate when
an operator runs `upgrade-all-service-instances`. The new certificates and CAs do
not expire for 5 years. 
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you do not run <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code>
    your certificates can expire. This can cause issues with backups, services bindings, and highly available clusters. </p>

+ Galera (soon to be renamed to HA Clusters) is compatible with plug-ins for Encryption at Rest.

+ Handling is improved for empty data directories on initialization.

+ MySQL for PCF relies significantly more on [BPM](https://bosh.io/docs/bpm/bpm/) (BOSH Process Manager) for how it launches jobs.

+ New MySQL property configurations improve performance of Galera plans.

+ Percona Server version is bumped to v5.7.24-26.

+ Golang version is bumped to 1.12.x.

### Resolved Issues

+ Java apps can use Galera plans with or without enabling TLS.

+ Internal diagnostic and backup components of Galera plans make troubleshooting easier and more accurate.

+ The drain script no longer times out.

There are no known issues for this release.
