VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v<%previous_version%>.x
version, upgrade to the latest v<%previous_version%>.x version
before upgrading to the latest v<%= current_version %>.x version.

backed up on the schedule configured by Operators. And Operators can use the `mysql-restore` utility to restore 
a multi-site instance from a backup.

+ **Metrics for Multi-site Leader-follower plans:** Multi-site replication instances will now metrics which can be viewed in realtime
using `cf tail`.

+ An error message appears when developers bind apps to custom schemas with invalid names. The error message shows the valid 
characters for custom schema names.

+ Operators can run the `recreate-all-service-instances` errand to re-create service instance VMs.

+ Application and service key bindings can start a connection successfully to service instances of single node, HA cluster, 
and multi-site leader-follower plans due to less stringent BOSH DNS hostname.

### Security Fix

This release includes the following security update:

+ Expired and unused certificates pertaining to HA clusters no longer live on the service instances.



### Resolved Issues

This release includes the following fixes:

+ An inaccurate generic message no longer appears when you use `cf update-service` to migrate data between a highly available 
(HA) cluster plan and a plan of another topology. MySQL for Pivotal Platform now fails fast to indicate 
that this is an unsupported workflow.

+ The MySQL tile now configures the endpoint url for s3 backups, and does not always uses the default AWS endpoint.

+ Operators can monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for persistent and ephemeral disk usage, and number of connections
on the Healthwatch Indicator Protocol dashboard. For more information, see Use the Indicator Protocol Dashboard.
