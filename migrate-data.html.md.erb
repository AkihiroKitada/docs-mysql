<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to migrate the data from any MySQL database to a MySQL
for <%= vars.platform_name %> v2.x service instance.

<%= partial "../../p-mysql/partials/mysql/galera_ga" %>

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The `mysql-tools` CLI plugin includes a `migrate` command.

To migrate data from a source MySQL instance to a new target MySQL instance in <%= vars.platform_name %>, you run the `migrate` command from your target org and space.
The command:

  1. Creates a new <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance in the target space.
  1. Copies the source data over to the new service instance.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> The <code>migrate</code> command  does not migrate all stored programs.
The command only migrates views and does not migrate triggers, routines, or events.
To manually migrate triggers, routines,	or events, contact <a href="https://pivotal.io/support">Pivotal Support</a>.</p>

## <a id='use-cases'></a>Use Cases

The workflows described in this topic support the following use cases:

+ Migrating from the deprecated
  [<%= vars.product_old %> v1.x](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/) to <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x.
+ Migrating from a single-node or leader-follower plan to highly available (HA) cluster plan.
+ Migrating from an HA cluster plan to single-node or leader-follower plan.
+ Migrating from an off-platform database to <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x.
+ Migrating from one availability zone (AZ) to another.

## <a id='how'></a>How the migrate Command Works

The `migrate` command performs a streaming `mysqldump` and restore to migrate
data from your source MySQL database to a target <%= vars.product_name %> v2 instance. This
command skips the following system schemas:

- `cf_metadata`
- `information_schema`
- `mysql`
- `performance_schema`
- `sys`

Additionally, the migration skips MySQL stored routines, events, and triggers.
Users must migrate these types of data manually.

The `migrate` command creates a new <%= vars.product_name %> v2 instance in the target space
and gives it the same name as the source MySQL service instance name.

The command also appends `-old` to the source service instance name, whether it is another <%= vars.platform_name %> MySQL service instance or a user-provided service created locally
to help migrate an off-platform database.

### <a id='security'></a>Security

The `migrate` command supports connections over TLS. If TLS is configured in
source and target MySQL instances, the channel through which data is streamed
is secured via TLS.

For information on how to configure TLS in your service instance,
see [Securing Service Instance Credentials with Runtime Credhub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/secure-si-creds.html).

### <a id='output'></a>Command Output

If migration is successful, the `migrate` command output includes a
<code>Migration completed successfully</code> message, as shown in this example:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf mysql-tools migrate my-instance db-small
2018/04/24 11:31:19 Creating new service instance "my-instance" for service p.mysql using plan db-small

2018/04/24 11:41:27 Migration completed successfully
2018/04/24 11:41:29 Cleaning up...
</pre>

If the migration is not successful, an error message appears.

### <a id='debugging'></a>Debugging

For debugging, you can add the optional `--no-cleanup` flag to the `migrate` command.

If a migration fails, this flag preserves the app that runs the migration task
and the newly-created service instances.
However, if a migration succeeds, the migration app is deleted
even when the `migrate` command included `--no-cleanup`.

## <a id='prepare'></a>Prerequisites

To perform the procedures in this topic, you must have the following:

* An existing MySQL database that is the data source you want to migrate from.
  This can be:
  * a <%= vars.product_old %> v1 service instance
  * a <%= vars.product_name %> v2 service instance
  * a non-Pivotal MySQL database
* <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x installed in the target <%= vars.platform_name %> environment you want to migrate to.
* A <%= vars.product_name %> service plan available in the targeted Org and Space you want
  to migrate your data to. The service plan should have the correct topology and
  resources for your target database.
  Talk to your operator to determine which service plan is appropriate.
  For more information, see <a href="recommended.html#persistent"> Persistent Disk Usage</a>.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To view available service plans, run <code>cf marketplace</code>.
  <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x appears as <code>p.mysql</code> and <%= vars.product_old %> v1.x appears as <code>p-mysql</code>.</p>

### <a id='sizing'></a>Resource Planning

Make sure the <%= vars.product_name %> v2 service plan that you use for your
migration target has your preferred VM type and persistent disk size.
When there is not enough space on disk to store the data, migration fails.

The service plan that you select for your target service instance should have a persistent disk that is:

  * **Single-Node** or **Leader-Follower**: Three times larger than the size of the source data.
  * **HA Cluster**: Two times larger than the size of the source data.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Migrating large datasets can take several hours.
Migration of the data is linear and depends on the hardware being used.
For example, if X amount of data takes 10 minutes to migrate, then 2X amount of data will take 20 minutes to migrate using the same hardware.
Do a test migration with small datasets to estimate how long the entire migration will take before migrating larger datasets.</p>

## <a id='install-plugin'></a>Install the mysql-tools CF CLI Plugin

Pivotal recommends that operators and developers use the `mysql-tools` cf CLI plugin to migrate
data from a source MySQL database to a <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance.

Do the following to install the `mysql-tools` cf CLI plugin:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf install-plugin -r CF-Community "MysqlTools"
    ```
2. Ensure the plugin has installed successfully by running the following command:

    ```
    cf mysql-tools version
    ```
3. You can run the following command to view plugin usage details:

    ```
    cf mysql-tools -h
    ```
    An example output:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf mysql-tools -h
    NAME:
       mysql-tools - Plugin to migrate mysql instances

    USAGE:
       cf mysql-tools migrate [-h] [--no-cleanup] &lt;v1-service-instance&gt; &lt;plan-type&gt;
       cf mysql-tools version
    </pre>

## <a id='source-access'></a>Set Up Source Access

The `migrate` command must be able to access the source database.
How you enable this access depends on where the source database is located relative to the target, as follows:

* **Migrating Within an Org and Space**: The `migrate` command can access the source without any preparation.
Continue to [Migrate Data](#migrate-data).
* **Migrating Across Spaces**: If the source database is in a different space from the target,
enable access through service-instance sharing, as described in [Source Access across Spaces](#across-spaces), below.
* **Migrating from Off-Platform**: If the source database is in a different <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation from the target, or not on any <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation,
create a user-provided service that accesses the remote database,
as described in [Source Access Off-Platform](#off-platform), below.

### <a id='across-spaces'></a>Source Access across Spaces

If your source MySQL service instance is in a different development space from your target org and space,
you can migrate your data by enabling service instance sharing for the source database.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Service instance sharing for <%= vars.product_name %> v2 is enabled by default.</p>

To set up service instance sharing for your source database, do the following:

1. Share the source MySQL service instance to your target org and space.

    ```
    cf share-service SOURCE-MYSQL-INSTANCE -o TARGET-ORG -s TARGET-SPACE
    ```

1. Verify that you can access the source service instance from the target org/space.
   First, run the following command to target your target org and space:

    ```
    cf target -o TARGET-ORG -s TARGET-SPACE
    ```
1. Then, run the following command to ensure your source service instance was
   shared successfully.

    ```
    cf services
    ```

After verifying that your source database service instance is in the `cf services` output, continue to [Migrate Data](#migrate-data), below.

### <a id='off-platform'></a>Source Access Off-Platform

If your source MySQL database is in a different <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation, or not deployed
on <%= vars.platform_name %> at all,
you can migrate your data by creating a local user-provided service instance that can access the database.

For more information on user-provided
service instances, see
[User-Provided Service Instances](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html).

To create a user-provided service instance to access the off-platform database, do the following:

1. Ensure your off-platform MySQL database allows inbound and outbound network
    traffic to your target <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation. You may need to modify firewall rules
    for your off-platform MySQL. Talk to your platform operator for assistance.
1. If your off-platform MySQL database requires connections over TLS, make sure
    that your <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation is configured to recognize the CA that the MySQL server
    certificate is signed with.
1. Collect the address, credentials, and other values needed to access your off-platform database.  These typically include the following:
  - `hostname`: Domain name or IP address of the off-platform source database
  - `name`: Name of source database
  - `username` and `password`: Database account credentials
  - `port`: Typically `3306`
  - `uri`: Query string for database access

1. Create a Cloud Foundry user-provided service instance that accesses the off-platform database:

    ```
    cf cups CF-DB-INSTANCE -p CREDS-STRUCT
    ```
   Where:
   * `CF-DB-INSTANCE` is the name that you want to give to the new database service instance that you are migrating to.
   * `CREDS-STRUCT` is a JSON structure that contains the off-platform database access values above.
   <br><br>
   For example:
   <pre class="terminal noselect">
   $ cf cups migrating-db -p '{"hostname": "34.192.88.212", "name": "my_db", \
   "username": "root", "password": "P455w0rD", "port": "3306", \
   "uri": "mysql<span>:</span>//root:P455w0rD<span>@</span>34.192.88.212:3306/my_db",}'
   Creating user provided service migrating-db in org my-org / space my-space as admin...
   OK
   </p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <code>cf cups</code> is a shortcut
    for the <code>cf create-user-provided-service</code> command.</p>

After seeing that your user-provided service instance was created, continue to [Migrate Data](#migrate-data), below.

## <a id='migrate-data'></a>Migrate Data

When your source database is accessible to your destination space, perform the following steps to migrate your data:

1. If your source MySQL service instance is running on <%= vars.platform_name %>, do the following to stop all traffic to the service instance, by stopping and unbinding all apps
that use it:

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To retrieve a list of bound apps, run <code>cf services</code> and see the <code>bound apps</code> column.</p>

    1. Use the cf CLI to target and log in to your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf target api.example.com
    $ cf login
    </pre>
    When prompted, enter your credentials and target the org and space where the service instance is located.

    1. Do the following for each app bound to the instance:

          1. Stop the app by running the following command:

              ```
              cf stop APP
              ```

              Where `APP` is the name of your app.

              For example:
              <pre class="terminal">
              $ cf stop my-app
              Stopping app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
              OK </pre>

          1. Unbind the app by running the following command:

              ```
              cf unbind-service APP SOURCE-INSTANCE
              ```
              Where:
              * `APP` is the name of your app.
              * `SOURCE-INSTANCE` is the name of your source <%= vars.product_name %> service instance.

              For example:
              <pre class="terminal">
              $ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance
              Unbinding app my-app from service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
              OK
              </pre>

1. Choose a service plan for your target <%= vars.product_name %> v2 instance.
For example, `db-small`.
  - To view available <%= vars.product_name %> v2 service plans, run `cf marketplace` and
  refer to the plans under `p.mysql`.

1. Migrate your data by running the following command:

    ```
    cf mysql-tools migrate SOURCE-INSTANCE V2-PLAN
    ```
    Where:
    * `SOURCE-INSTANCE` is the name of your source MySQL service instance
     or user-provided service instance.
    * `V2-PLAN` is the name of the service plan that you chose above.

## <a id='validate-data'></a>Validate Data

After migrating your data, you must verify that the data has successfully migrated by validating the data in the new <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance.
You can validate the data by creating an SSH tunnel to gain direct command line access to the new <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance.

Do the following to create an SSH tunnel to the instance and validate your data:

1. Create an SSH tunnel to your <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance.
To do this, perform the steps in the
following sections of [Accessing Services with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html):

    1. Push Your Host App

    1. Create Your Service Key

    1. Configure Your SSH Tunnel

    1. Access Your Service Instance

1. From the MySQL shell, validate that the data that you expect to see has been imported into the <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance.

1. Exit the MySQL shell and kill the SSH tunnel.

## <a id='rebind-restage'></a>Rebind and Restage Apps

To complete the migration, rebind and restage any apps that had been bound to the original <%= vars.product_name %> service instance.

Do the following to rebind and restage your apps:

1. Bind the app to the new service instance.
Run the following command:

    ```
    cf bind-service APP V2-INSTANCE
    ```
    <br>
    Where:
    * `APP` is the name of your app.
    * `V2-INSTANCE` is the name of your <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf bind-service my-app my-v2-instance
    Binding service my-v2-instance to app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    TIP: Use 'cf restage my-app' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
    </pre>

1. Restage the app.
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf restage my-app
  Restaging app my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
  [...]
  </pre>
  The app is now using your new <%= vars.product_name %> v2.x service instance and should be operational again.

## <a id='delete-old-database'></a> Delete the Old Database

After rebinding and restaging your apps to confirm that migration was successful, Pivotal recommends saving resources by deleting the old database instance.

If your source database is deployed on <%= vars.platform_name %>, perform the deletion by running the following command:

  ```
  cf delete-service SOURCE-INSTANCE
  ```
  <br>
  Where `SOURCE-INSTANCE` is the name of your old database instance.

  For example:

  <pre class="terminal">$ cf delete-service my-instance</pre>
