## <a id="monitoring-8.14.0"></a>mysql-monitoring v8.14.0

- **Bug fix:** `mysql-diag` now fails quickly when VMs in the cluster aren't available

## <a id="monitoring-8.13.0"></a>mysql-monitoring v8.13.0

- **New:** Added metrics that represent disk usage as percentages. This makes it easier to alert on disk usage without knowing the deployment's disk size. See the [disk monitoring documentation](monitoring-mysql.html#disk-free) for more information.
  - /p-mysql/system/persistent\_disk\_used\_percent
  - /p-mysql/system/ephemeral\_disk\_used\_percent
  - /p-mysql/system/persistent\_disk\_inodes\_used\_percent

## <a id="monitoring-8.12.0"></a>mysql-monitoring v8.12.0

- **New:** Several new metrics which report disk space usage.
