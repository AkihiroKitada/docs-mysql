Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line, then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line. For example, if you use an older v1.7.x version, upgrade to the latest v1.7.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.8.x version.

See the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf) for product versions and upgrade paths.
