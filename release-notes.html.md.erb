VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v<%= previous_version %>.x
version, upgrade to the latest v<%= previous_version %>.x version
before upgrading to the latest v<%= current_version %>.x version.
