This topic describes how to configure automated backups for MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF),
and how to manually restore a MySQL service instance from a backup.

## <a id="overview"></a>About Automated Backups

Automated backups do the following:

- Periodically create and upload backups suitable for restoring all of the databases used by the service instance.
- Operate without locking apps out of the database; no downtime.
- Include a metadata file that contains the critical details of the backup, including the calendar time of the backup.
- Encrypt backups within the MySQL for PCF VM; unencrypted data is never transported outside the MySQL for PCF deployment.

### <a id="understanding-metadata"></a> Backup Files and Metadata

When MySQL for PCF runs a backup, it uploads two files with Unix epoch-timestamped filenames of the form `mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP`:

  * The encrypted data backup file `mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP.tar.gpg`
  * A metadata file `mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP.txt`

The metadata file contains information about the backup and looks like this:

```
ibbackup_version = 2.4.5
end_time = 2017-04-24 21:00:03
lock_time = 0
binlog_pos =
incremental = N
encrypted = N
server_version = 5.7.16-10-log
start_time = 2017-04-24 21:00:00
tool_command = --user=admin --password=... --stream=tar tmp/
innodb_from_lsn = 0
innodb_to_lsn = 2491844
format = tar
compact = N
name =
tool_name = innobackupex
partial = N
compressed = N
uuid = fd13cf26-2930-11e7-871e-42010a000807
tool_version = 2.4.5
```

Within this file, the most important items are the `start_time` and the `server_version` entries.

The backup process does not interrupt MySQL service, but backups only reflect transactions that completed before their `start_time`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Although both <code>compressed</code> and <code>encrypted</code> show as <code>N</code> in this file,
the backup uploaded by MySQL for PCF is both compressed and encrypted. This is a known issue.</p>

### <a id="enable-backups"></a> Enabling Automated Backups

You can configure MySQL for PCF to automatically back up its databases to external storage.

* **How and where**---There are four options for how automated backups transfer backup data and where the data saves to:
  - [Option 1: Back up with SCP](#scp)---MySQL for PCF runs an SCP command that secure-copies backups to a VM or physical machine operating outside of PCF.
   The operator provisions the backup machine separately from their PCF installation. This is the fastest option.
  - [Option 2: Back up to Ceph or S3](#ceph-or-s3)---MySQL for PCF runs an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) client that saves backups to an S3 bucket,
    a [Ceph](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/) storage cluster, or another S3-compatible endpoint certified by Pivotal.
  - [Option 3: Back up to GCS](#gcs)---MySQL for PCF runs an [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) SDK that saves backups to an Google Cloud Storage bucket.
  - [Option 4: Back up to Azure Storage](#azure)---MySQL for PCF runs an [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/) SDK that saves backups to an Azure storage account.

* **When**---Backups follow a schedule that you specify with a [cron](http://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) expression.

* **What is backed up**---Each MySQL instance backs up its entire MySQL data directory, consistent to a specific point in time.

To enable and configure automated backups, follow the procedures below according to the option you choose for external storage.

## <a id="scp"></a> Option 1: Back Up with SCP

SCP enables the operator to use any desired storage solution on the destination VM.

To back up your database using SCP, complete the following procedures:

+ [Create a Public and Private Key Pair](#scp-keys)
+ [Configure Backups in Ops Manager](#configure-scp)

### <a id="scp-keys"></a> Create a Public and Private Key Pair

MySQL for PCF accesses a remote host as a user with a private key for authentication. Pivotal recommends that this user and key pair be solely for MySQL for PCF.

1. Determine the remote host that you will be using to store backups for MySQL for PCF. Ensure that the MySQL service instances can access
   the remote host.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends using a VM outside the PCF deployment for the destination of SCP backups. As a result you may need to enable public IPs for the MySQL VMs. </p>

1. (Recommended) Create a new user for MySQL for PCF on the destination VM.

1. (Recommended) Create a new public and private key pair for authenticating as the above user on the destination VM.

### <a id="configure-scp"></a> Configure Backups in Ops Manager

Use Ops Manager to configure MySQL for PCF to backup using SCP.

1. In Ops Manager, open the MySQL for PCF tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select the **SCP** radio button.
    ![SCP Backup Configuration Form](scp-backups.png)

1. Fill in the fields as follows:<br><br>
    * **Username**---Enter the user that you created above.
    * **Private Key**---Enter the private key that you created above. The public key should be stored for ssh and scp access on the destination VM.
    * **Hostname**---Enter the IP or DNS entry that should be used to access the destination VM.
    * **Destination Directory**---Enter the directory in which MySQL for PCF should upload backups.
    * **Cron Schedule**---Enter a `cron` schedule, using standard [cron syntax](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto), to take backups of each service instance.
    * **Fingerprint**---Enter the fingerprint of the destination VM's public key. This helps to detect any changes to the destination VM.
    * **Enable Email Alerts**---Select to receive email notifications when a backup failure occurs.
          Also verify that you have done the following:
          - Added all users who need to be notified about failed backups to System org and System space</li>
          - Configured Email Notifications in Elastic Runtime,
          see <em>Configure Email Notifications</em> for your IaaS:

## <a id="ceph-or-s3"></a> Option 2: Back Up to Ceph or S3

To back up your database on Ceph or Amazon S3, complete the following procedures:

+ [Create a Policy and Access Key](#access-key-aws)
+ [Configure Backups in Ops Manager](#configure-aws)

### <a id="access-key-aws"></a> Create a Policy and Access Key

MySQL for PCF accesses your S3 store through a user account. Pivotal recommends that this account be solely for MySQL for PCF. You must apply a minimal policy that lets the user account upload backups to your S3 store.

1. Create a policy for your MySQL for PCF user account. 

    <br>Policy creation varies depending on the S3 provider. Follow the relevant procedure to give MySQL for PCF the following permissions:<br><br>
      * List and upload to buckets
      * (Optional) Create buckets in order to use buckets that do not already exist  

    For example, in AWS, to create a new custom policy, go to **IAM** > **Policies** > **Create Policy** > **Create Your Own Policy** and paste in the following permissions:  
     <pre class="highlight json">
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ServiceBackupPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::MY\_BUCKET\_NAME/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::MY\_BUCKET\_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

1. (Recommended) Create a new user for MySQL for PCF and record its Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, the user credentials.

1. Attach the policy you created to the AWS user account that MySQL for PCF will use to access S3 (**IAM** > **Policies** > **Policy Actions** > **Attach**).

### <a id="configure-aws"></a> Configure Backups in Ops Manager

Use Ops Manager to connect MySQL for PCF to your S3 account.

1. In Ops Manager, open the MySQL for PCF tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select the **Ceph or Amazon S3** radio button.  
    ![S3 Backup Configuration Form](S3-backups.png)

1. Fill in the fields as follows:<br><br>
      * **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**---Enter the S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from above.
      * **Endpoint URL**---Enter the S3 compatible endpoint URL for uploading backups. URL must start with `http://` or `https://`. The default is https://s3.amazonaws.com
      * **Region**---Enter the region in which your bucket is located.
      * **Bucket Name**---Enter the bucket name in which to upload.
      * **Bucket Path**---Enter the path in the bucket to store backups.
      * **Cron Schedule**---Enter a `cron` schedule, using standard [cron syntax](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto), to take backups of each service instance.
      * **Enable Email Alerts**---Select to receive email notifications when a backup failure occurs.
          Also verify that you done the following:
          * Added all users who need to be notified about failed backups to System org and System space</li>
          * Configured Email Notifications in Elastic Runtime,
          see <em>Configure Email Notifications</em> for your IaaS:

## <a id="gcs"></a> Option 3: Back Up to GCS

To back up your database on Google Cloud Storage (GCS), complete the following procedures:

+ [Create a Policy and Access Key](#access-key)
+ [Configure Backups in Ops Manager](#configure-gcs)

### <a id="access-key"></a> Create a Policy and Access Key

MySQL for PCF accesses your GCS store through a service account. Pivotal recommends that this account be solely for MySQL for PCF. You must apply a minimal policy that lets the user account upload backups to your GCS store.

1. In the GCS console, create a new service account for MySQL for PCF: **IAM and Admin** > **Service Accounts** > **Create Service Account**.<br><br>

      MySQL for PCF needs the following permissions for this account:
      * List and upload to buckets
      * (Optional) Create buckets in order to use buckets that do not already exist  


1. Enter a unique name in the **Service account name** field, such as `MySQL-for-PCF`.

1. In the **Roles** dropdown, grant the `MySQL-for-PCF` service account the **Storage Admin** role.

1. Check the **Furnish a new private key** box so that a new key is created and downloaded.

1. Click **Create** and take note of the name and location of the service account JSON file that is downloaded.

## <a id="disable-backups"></a>Disable Automated Backups

To disable MySQL for PCF automated backups:

1. In Ops Manager, open the MySQL for PCF tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select **Disable Backups**.  
![Disable Backups](disable-backups.png)

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="manual-backup"></a> Manual Backup

Back up your data manually with [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html). This backup
acquires a global read lock on all tables, but does not hold it for the entire duration of the dump.

Follow these steps to backup a MySQL for PCF service instance VM:

1. Determine the GUID associated with your service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service SERVICE_INSTANCE --guid
 </pre>

1. Download the manifest for the service instance deployment using the GUID from above:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh download manifest service-instance_GUID ./manifest.yml
 </pre>

1. Set the BOSH deployment to the downloaded manifest:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh deployment ./manifest.yml
 </pre>

1. Find the IP address of the MySQL service instance VM:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh instances
 </pre>

1. Find the admin password for the service instance in the manifest:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cat ./manifest.yml | grep admin_password
 </pre>

1. Use mysqldump to backup the database:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ mysqldump -u admin -p -h $MYSQL_IP --all-databases --single-transaction > backup.sql
 </pre>

## <a id="restore"></a> Restore a Service Instance from Backup

Restoring MySQL for PCF from backup is a manual process primarily intended for disaster recovery.
Restoring a MySQL for PCF service instance replaces all of its data and running state.

To restore a MySQL for PCF instance from an offsite backup, download the backup and restore to a new instance by following these procedures:

+ [Download the Backup Artifact](#download)
+ [Restore the Service Instance](#restoreinstance)

###<a id="download"></a> Download the Backup Artifact

These instructions assume that you are using S3 as your backup destination.
If you are using one of the other backup options, steps 5, 6, and 8 are different.

1. Run `cf service` to determine the GUID associated with the service instance that you want to restore:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service MY_INSTANCE_NAME --guid
  12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef
 </pre>

2. Follow the [Advanced Troubleshooting](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/customizing/trouble-advanced.html) instructions to log into the Ops Manager VM, where you can run the BOSH CLI.

3. Download the manifest for the service instance deployment using the GUID from above:
  <pre class="terminal">
   $ bosh download manifest service-instance_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef ./manifest.yml
  </pre>

4. Inspect the downloaded manifest and record the following properties for later:<br><br>
  * `properties.cf-mysql-backup.symmetric_key` also referred to as an encryption key - this will be used later to decrypt the backup artifact.
  * `properties.service-backup.destinations[0].config.bucket_name` which is the bucket that the backups are uploaded to.
  * `properties.service-backup.destinations[0].config.bucket_path` the path within the bucket above.

5. Log in to the AWS CLI.
   For information and to download the CLI, see [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

6. List the available backups for the instance, replacing `BUCKET_NAME` and `BUCKET_PATH` with values from above.
  The artifacts are sorted by time. 
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ aws s3 ls --recursive s3://BUCKET\_NAME/BUCKET\_PATH/service-instance\_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef/
 </pre>

7. Choose the most recent backup file, or an older backup you want to restore from. The backups are timestamped in the filename and have a `.gpg` extension.

8. Download the selected backup:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ aws s3 cp s3://$BUCKET\_NAME/$BUCKET\_PATH/service-instance\_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef/YEAR/MONTH/DATE/mysql-backup-1489168980-0.tar.gpg ./a-local-path/mysql-backup-1489168980-0.tar.gpg
 </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also log in to AWS and download S3 backups from a browser.</p>

###<a id="restoreinstance"></a> Restore the Service Instance

Because restoring a service instance is destructive, Pivotal recommends that you restore to a new and unused service instance. 

These instructions assume you have a backup downloaded. 

To restore the backup to a new service instance, follow these procedures:

* [Create and Prepare a New Service Instance for Restore](#prepare)<br>
* [Run the Restore Utility](#runrestore)

#### <a id="prepare"></a> Create and Prepare a New Service Instance for Restore

1. Determine the service plan associated with the old service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service OLD\_INSTANCE\_NAME
 </pre>

1. [Create a new service instance](./use.html#create) using the same service plan to restore to:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf create-service p.mysql db-small NEW\_SERVICE\_INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Monitor the status of the service instance creation; it may take several minutes as the VM is created.
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service NEW\_SERVICE\_INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Determine the GUID associated with your service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf service NEW\_SERVICE\_INSTANCE --guid
 </pre>

1. Download the BOSH manifest for the service instance using the GUID from above:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh download manifest service-instance_GUID ./manifest.yml
 </pre>

1. Determine and record the MySQL admin password:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cat ./manifest | grep admin_password
 </pre>

1. Set the BOSH deployment to the newly downloaded manifest:
 <pre class="terminal">
     $ bosh deployment ./manifest.yml
 </pre>

1. Find and record the MySQL instance name and GUID from BOSH:
 <pre class="terminal">
     $ bosh instances
 </pre>

1. Copy the downloaded backup to the new service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ bosh scp mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP.tar.gpg BOSH-INSTANCE:DESTINATION-PATH
 </pre>
   where:<br><br>
   - `BOSH-INSTANCE` is `mysql/INSTANCE-GUID`, determined from the previous step. For example, `mysql/d7ff8d46-c3e8-449f-aea7-5a05b0a1929c`.
   - `DESTINATION-PATH` is the location to copy the backup artifact to on the BOSH VM. For example, `/tmp/`.
   <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You may see `stderr` output. This is normal.</p>

1. Use the BOSH CLI to [`ssh`](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh) in to the newly created MySQL service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh ssh mysql
 </pre>

1. After securely logging into MySQL, run `sudo su` to become root:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo su
 </pre>

1. Create the directory structure the tooling expects by creating a `restore-artifact` directory:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ mkdir /var/vcap/store/restore-artifact/
 </pre>

1. Move the backup artifact to the script's expected location:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ mv /tmp/mysql-backup-1498863859-0.tar.gpg /var/vcap/store/restore-artifact/
 </pre>

#### <a id="runrestore"></a> Run the Restore Utility

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This is a destructive action and should only be run on a new and unused service instance.</p>

1. Run the restore utility to restore the backup artifact into the data directory. This process:<br><br> 
    * deletes any existing data
    * decrypts and untars the backup artifact
    * restores the backup artifact into the mysql data directory
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ /var/vcap/packages/mysql-restore/bin/restore --encryption-key ENCRYPTION\_KKEY --mysql-username admin --mysql-password ADMIN\_PASSWORD
 </pre>
  where:<br><br>
  * `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is the `symmetric-key` value from above
  * `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is the `admin_password` value from above

1. Exit the MySQL VM.

1. Determine if the application is currently bound to a MySQL service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf services
 </pre>

1. If the previous step shows that the app is currently bound to a MySQL instance, unbind it:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf unbind-service MY\_APP OLD\_SERVICE\_INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Update your CF app to bind to the new service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf bind-service MY\_APP  NEW\_SERVICE\_INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Restage your CF app to make the changes take effect:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf restage MY\_APP 
 </pre>

Your app should be running and able to access the restored data.
