title: About Service-Gateway Access
owner: MySQL

Service-gateway access enables a MySQL service instance to
connect to external components that are not on the same foundation as the service instance.
This is also referred to as _off-platform access_ because the components,
that are not hosted on the foundation, or platform,
can access MySQL service instances that are on the platform.

These components, typically apps, can be on another foundation or hosted outside of the foundation.

* [Create a Service Instance with Service-Gateway Access](./create-service-gateway-instance.html)


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Use cases for service-gateway access in <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>) are:

- Accessing a MySQL service instance from apps deployed in a different foundation

- Using MySQL as a service for apps that are not deployed to <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>
  (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>)


## <a id='architecture'></a> Architecture

Service-gateway access to MySQL service instances leverages the TCP router in
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

Any database requests that an app makes are forwarded through DNS to a load balancer that can route
traffic from outside to inside the foundation.
This load balancer opens a range of ports that are reserved for MySQL database traffic.
When an app developer creates a service instance with service-gateway access enabled, a
port from the range is provisioned for that service instance.
The load balancer then forwards the requests for this MySQL service instance to
the TCP router.
The TCP router internally load balances between the MySQL service instance nodes.

The diagram below shows how the traffic is routed from apps to the MySQL service instance nodes in this case.
All apps using this MySQL service instance follow the same route,
irrespective of whether they are hosted on a different foundation or are hosted outside of the foundation.
