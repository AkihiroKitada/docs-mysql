## <a id="config-on-demand"></a> Configure the Tile

Follow the steps below to configure the MySQL for PCF service. MySQL for PCF v2.0 has five service plans that deploy dedicated MySQL service instances on demand.

By default, MySQL for PCF has 3 active plans. The 4th and 5th plans are not active by default.

1. Select the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane and configure the fields as follows:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the Availability Zone (AZ) that you want the MySQL broker VM to run in. The broker runs as a singleton job.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Ignore; not used.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select a subnet for the MySQL broker. This is typically the same subnet that includes the Elastic Runtime component VMs.<br>
            This network is represented by the Default Network in this <a href="./about.html#on-demand">picture</a>.
            </td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
        <td> Select the subnet for the on-demand service instances, the Services Network in this <a href="./about.html#on-demand">picture</a>.</td></tr>
  </table>
