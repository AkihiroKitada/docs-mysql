<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions for developers using the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service for their
PCF apps. MySQL provides a relational database for apps and devices.

These procedures use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information,
see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

You can also use [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html) to do the same tasks using a graphical UI.


## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To use MySQL for PCF with your PCF apps, you need:

* A PCF installation with [MySQL for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql) installed and listed
in the [Marketplace](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/#instances)
* A [Space Developer](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#roles) or Admin account on the PCF installation
* A local machine with the following installed:
   - a browser
   - a shell
   - the [Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI)
   - the Linux [watch](http://www.linfo.org/watch.html) command
* To [log in to](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) the org and space containing your app


## <a id='process'></a>The Process for Using MySQL for PCF in Your App

To use MySQL in a PCF app:

1. Check the service availability in the Marketplace,
   and see if there is an existing instance of MySQL for PCF in your space.

    See [Confirm the MySQL for PCF Service Availability](#marketplace), below.

2. If there is no existing instance or you want to use a different one,
   create an instance of the MySQL for PCF service in the same space as the app.

    See [Create a Service Instance](#create), below.

3. Push your app into the same space as the MySQL for PCF service instance,
   using `cf push`.

    For information about `cf push`,
   see [Push](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/cf-cli/getting-started.html#push).

4. Bind the app to the MySQL for PCF service instance, to enable the app to use MySQL.

    See [Bind a Service Instance to Your App](#bind), below.

5. Call the MySQL for PCF service in your app code, and then re-push your app into the space.

    See [Use the MySQL Service in Your App](#call), below.



## <a id='marketplace'></a>Confirm the MySQL for PCF Service Availability

For an app to use the MySQL for PCF service, both of the following must be true:

* The service must be available in the Marketplace for its space.
* An instance of the service must exist in its space.

You can confirm both of these using the cf CLI as follows.

### <a id="check-marketplace"></a> Check Service Availability in the Marketplace

To find out if a MySQL for PCF service is available in the Marketplace, do the following:

1. Enter the following command:

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```

1. If the output lists `p.mysql` in the `service` column, MySQL for PCF is available.
   If it is not available, ask your operator to install it.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service             plans          description
    [...]
    p.mysql             db-small       Dedicated instances of MySQL service to provide a relational database
    [...]
    </pre>

### <a id="check-instance"></a> Check That an Instance Is Running in the Space

To confirm that a MySQL for PCF instance is running in the space, do the following:

1. Use the [cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) or
[Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/console-login.html) to log in to the org and space that contains the app.
1. Enter the following command:

    ```
    cf services
    ```
1. Any `p.mysql` listings in the `service` column are service instances of MySQL for PCF in the space.
<br><br>
For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service     plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql     db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>
    You can [bind](#bind) your app to an existing instance or [create](#create) a new instance to bind to your app.

## <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

On-demand services are created asynchronously, not immediately.
The `watch` command shows you when your service instance is ready to bind and use.

To create an instance of the MySQL for PCF service, do the following:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf create-service p.mysql PLAN SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where:<br>
    - `PLAN` is the name of the MySQL for PCF plan you want to use.
    - `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is a name you choose to identify the service instance.
    This name appears under `service` in output from `cf services`.

1. Enter the following command and wait for the `last operation` for
your instance to show as `create succeeded`.

    ```
    watch cf services
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf create-service p.mysql db-small my-instance<br>
    Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK<br>
   $ watch cf services<br>
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service       plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql       db-small                  create succeeded
</pre>

    If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting Instances](./troubleshoot-instances.html).

## <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind the app to a service instance. Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

To bind an app to a MySQL for PCF instance run the following command:

```
cf bind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
```

Where:<br>

- `APP` is the app you want to use the MySQL service instance.<br>
- `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Binding service mydb to my-app in org my-org / space test as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf push' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

## <a id="call"></a>Use the MySQL Service in Your App

To access the MySQL service from your app:

1. Verify that your app code (or the MySQL client library that the app uses) retries in the case of DNS timeouts.

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf env APP-NAME
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of the app bound to the MySQL for PCF instance.

1. In the output, note the connection strings listed in the `VCAP_SERVICES` > `credentials` object for the app.

1. In your app code, call the MySQL service using the connection strings.<br><br>
  See this example [Node.js code](./using-tls.html#call-service).

###<a id="schema"></a>Create and Use Custom Schemas
  
  MySQL for PCF v2.3 and later supports multiple custom schemas.
  You can use custom schemas with apps that share a MySQL service instance to isolate app data by schema.
  By default, service bindings use the default schema `service_instance_db`. 
  
  To use custom schemas in your apps do the following:
  
  1. To create a custom schema using the MySQL client, do the procedures in [3.3.1 Creating and Selecting a Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/creating-database.html) in the MySQL documentation. 
  <br><br>
    For more information about the `CREATE DATABASE` SQL statement, see [
    13.1.12 CREATE DATABASE Syntax](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/create-database.html).
    
  2. To modify your app to use your custom schema, do one of the following: 
    + If your app is written in Java, construct a `jdbcUrl` that uses your custom schema. 
    + If your app is not written in Java, modify your app to use your custom schema in the `name` credentials property for `VCAP_SERVICES`.
    
    For more information about the environment variable credentials hash `VCAP_SERVICES`, see [MySQL Environment Variables](./reference.html).
  3. Push your app using `cf push`.

## <a id="manage"></a> Manage Service Instances

This section describes tasks you do over the life cycle of your apps and data:

+ Moving your data to a different plan.
+ Removing an app's access to a service it no longer needs.
+ Deleting a service instance that is not used.

### <a id="update"></a>Update a Service Instance to a Larger Plan

As apps and their databases grow, it may be necessary to update the service instance to a larger plan.
This does not require a rebinding of your app. However, while the instance is being migrated to a new service instance,
the database will be unavailable for several minutes.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> You cannot update to or from a highly available (HA) cluster plan
  to a plan that uses a single-node or leader-follower topology using the <code>update-service</code> command. To update to or from HA cluster plan, you must migrate your data to a new service instance using the <code>cf mysql-tools</code>  plugin. For more information about migrating data, see <a href="./migrate-data.html">Migrating Data in MySQL for PCF</a>.</p>

To update a service instance to a larger plan, run the following command:

```
cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -p PLAN
```

Where `PLAN` is the plan you want to upgrade the service instance to.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-service my-instance -p db-large
</pre>


### <a id="unbind"></a>Unbind an App from a Service Instance

To stop an app from using a service it no longer needs, run the following command to unbind the app from the service:

```
cf unbind-service APP SERVICE-INSTANCE
```

Where:<br>

- `APP` is the app you want to stop using the MySQL service instance. <br>
- `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Unbinding app my-app from service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
</pre>

### <a id="delete"></a>Delete a Service Instance

You cannot delete a service instance that an app is bound to.

To delete a service instance, do the following:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf delete-service SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the service to delete.
    <br><br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf delete-service my-instance<br>
    Are you sure you want to delete the service my-instance ? y
    Deleting service my-service in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    </pre>

1. Enter the following command and wait for a `Service instance not found` error indicating
that the instance no longer exists:

    ```
    watch cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```

<%= partial '../../p-mysql/odb/log-cache-cli-plugin' %>

##<a id='establish-tls'></a> Establish a TLS Connection to a Service Instance

You can use `mysql` to establish a TLS connection to a MySQL for PCF service instance that has TLS
enabled. For more information about how to enable TLS for a service instance, see [Using TLS](using-tls.html).

To establish a TLS connection to a service instance, do the following:

1. Create a new service key for the service instance with TLS enabled. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service-key my-service-instance my-tls-service-key
  {
   "hostname": "q-n3s3y1.q-g693.bosh",
   "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql<span>://</span>q-n3s3y1.q-g693.bosh:3306/service\_instance\_db?user=6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c\u0026password=a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa\u0026=true",
   "name": "service\_instance\_db",
   "password": "a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa",
   "port": 3306,
   "tls": {
    "cert": {
     "ca": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\...n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
    }
   },
   "uri": "mysql<span>://</span>6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c:a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa<span>@</span>q-n3s3y1.q-g693.bosh:3306/service\_instance\_db?reconnect=true",
   "username": "6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c"
  }
  </pre>
  If the service key does not have a CA certificate under `tls.cert.ca`, the service key may be stale.
  Create a new one.

1. Copy the contents of the CA certificate under `tls.cert.ca` and paste it into a file. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ pbpaste > root.pem</pre>

1. Record the values for `username`, `password`, and `hostname`.

1. Use `mysql` to establish a TLS connection to the MySQL instance.
  Run the following command:
  <pre><code>mysql --host=HOSTNAME \
    --user=USERNAME \
    --password=PASSWORD \
    --ssl-ca=root.pem \
    --ssl-verify-server-cert</code></pre>
  <br>
  Where:
    * `HOSTNAME` is the value for `hostname` retrieved above.
    * `USERNAME` is the value for `username` retrieved above.
    * `PASSWORD` is the value for `password` retrieved above.
  <br><br>
  For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ mysql --hostname=q-n3s3y1.q-g693.bosh \
      --user=6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c \
      --password=a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa \
      --ssl-ca=root.pem \
      --ssl-verify-server-cert
    </pre>

##<a id='remote-connection'></a>Establish a Connection to a Service Instance From Outside Your PCF Deployment

If you want to connect to a MySQL service instance from outside the PCF deployment
where your MySQL for PCF service instance is located, you can do one of the following:

+ [Connect Using an SSH Tunnel](#ssh-tunnel)
+ [Connect Using an IP Address](#ip-address)

You may want to use an SSH tunnel or IP address for establishing a connection when:

+ Connecting from a local workstation. For more information, see [MySQL for PCF Tools](#mysql-for-pcf-tools).
+ Connecting from an external PCF deployment.
+ Connecting from a legacy app that is not in a PCF deployment.
+ Taking a manual backup to be stored locally.
  For more information, see [Manual Backup](./backup-and-restore.html#manual-backup).

###<a id='ssh-tunnel'></a> Connect Using an SSH Tunnel

Any app deployed within a PCF deployment can resolve BOSH DNS hostnames and forward
traffic to MySQL service instances using an SSH tunnel.

#### Prerequisite

To connect using an SSH tunnel, you must have SSH access to app containers.
For more information, see [Configuring SSH Access for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/config-ssh.html).

#### Procedure

To connect to a MySQL instance using an SSH tunnel, follow the procedures in
[Accessing Services with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html)

###<a id='ip-address'></a> Connect Directly to an IP Address

You can also connect remotely to the MySQL service instance by directly using its IP address.

You can obtain the IP address, using one the following methods:

+  Using cf SSH. For more information, see
[Obtain the IP Address Using cf SSH](#ip-address-cf-ssh).

+  Using the DNS Lookup app. For more information, see
[Obtain the IP Address Using the DNS Lookup App](#ip-address-lookup).

+  Using the BOSH CLI. For more information, see
[Obtain the IP Address Using the BOSH CLI](#ip-address-bosh).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> By connecting to the MySQL service instance directly using its
IP address, the client is responsible to handle cases in which the IP address of the service
instance will change transparently. This can happen when a VM is recreated, or during a failover.</p>

####<a id='ip-address-cf-ssh'></a> Obtain the IP Address Using cf SSH

If you have limited access to the platform you can obtain the IP address through
cf SSH.

##### Prerequisites

To obtain the IP address using cf SSH, you must have the following:

+ SSH access to app containers. For more information, see
[Configuring SSH Access for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/config-ssh.html).

+ An app deployed on the same deployment as the MySQL service instance.

##### Procedure

To obtain the IP address using cf SSH, follow these steps:

1. To retrieve your service key, run the following command:

    ```
    cf service-keys SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your MySQL for PCF service instance.

1. To obtain the BOSH DNS hostname of the MySQL service instance, run the following command:

    ```
    cf service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY
    ```

     For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf service-key my-mysql my-service-key
    Getting key my-service-key for service instance my-mysql as admin...

    {
     "hostname": "q-n1a2b3.q-c456.bosh",
     "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://10.10.10.5:3306/cf_e2d148a8_1baa_4961_b314_2431f57037e5?user=my_unique_name\u0026password=123456789",
     "name": "cf_e2d148a8_1baa_4961_b314_2431f57037e5",
     "password": "123456789",
     "port": 3306,
     "uri": "mysql://my_unique_name:123456789@10.10.10.5:3306/cf_e2d148a8_1baa_4961_b314_2431f57037e5?reconnect=true",
     "username": "myuser"
    }
    </pre>

1. Record the value of `hostname`.

1. To SSH into the app, run the following command:

    ```
    $ cf ssh APP-NAME
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is the name of your app deployed on the same deployment as
    the MySQL service instance.

1. To obtain the IP address of the service instance, run the following command:

    ```
    $ dig +short BOSH-DNS-HOSTNAME
    ```
    Where `BOSH-DNS-HOSTNAME` is the BOSH DNS hostname that you retrieved from step 2.

     The output of the command is the IP address.

####<a id='ip-address-lookup'></a> Obtain the IP Address Using the DNS Lookup App

![DNS Lookup App](dns-lookup-app.png)

If your deployment has app SSH disabled, you can deploy the DNS Lookup app to your
deployment. The DNS Lookup app resolves BOSH DNS hostnames.

For more information, see the [dns-lookup](https://github.com/menicosia/dns-lookup)
repository in GitHub.

####<a id='ip-address-bosh'></a> Obtain the IP Address Using the BOSH CLI

If you have access to the BOSH CLI, you can obtain the IP address through it.

#### Prerequisite

To connect using the BOSH CLI, you must have have access to the BOSH CLI. Ask
your operator for access to the BOSH CLI.

#### Procedure

To connect using the BOSH CLI, follow these steps:

1. To obtain the credentials and IP address needed to use the BOSH CLI, follow
the procedure in [Gather Credential and IP Address Information](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather).

1. To SSH into your Ops Manager VM, follow the procedure in
[Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh)
for your IaaS.

1. To log in to your BOSH Director, follow the procedure in
[Log in to the BOSH Director VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in).

1. To obtain the MySQL service instance GUID, run the following command:

      ```
      cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE --guid
      ```

      Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your MySQL for PCF service instance.

1. To use the BOSH CLI to view the IP address, run one of the following
commands depending on your topology:
    + If your MySQL service instance topology is single node or highly available
    (HA) cluster, run the following command:

        ```
        bosh -d service-instance_GUID instance
        ```

        Where `GUID` is the GUID of the service instance retrieved above. <br><br>

        If you are using an HA cluster, record the IP address of any of your instances.<br><br>

        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -d service-instance\_b2e92d56-27e2-407e-90e0-c34612c10dba \
            instances

        </pre>
    + If your MySQL service instance topology is leader-follower, run the following
    command:

        ```
        bosh -d service-instance_GUID run-errand inspect
        ```

        Record the IP address for the instance marked `Role: leader`. <br><br>

        For example:
        <pre class="terminal">

## <a id="dev-tools"></a>MySQL for PCF Tools

The following tools let developers access their MySQL for PCF databases.

### <a id="mysqlweb"></a>Pivotal MySQLWeb Database Management App

The Pivotal MySQLWeb app provides a web-based UI for managing MySQL for PCF databases.
The free app lets you view and operate on tables, indexes, constraints, and other database structures,
and directly execute SQL commands.

![Pivotal MySQLWeb](mysqlweb.png)

You can run the Pivotal MySQLWeb app in two ways:

* Standalone on your own machine
* Deployed to PCF

If you deploy Pivotal MySQLWeb to PCF, you can configure it in the deployment manifest to automatically
bind to a specific service instance.

See the Pivotal MySQLWeb [code repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/PivotalMySQLWeb) and
[demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2wmRcJj8XF-SXloNFNNaGJXbFk/view),
for how to install and run Pivotal MySQLWeb.

### <a id="plugin"></a>cf CLI MySQL Plugin

To connect to your MySQL for PCF databases from a command line, use the cf CLI MySQL plugin.
The plugin lets you:

* Inspect databases for debugging
* Manually adjust database schema or contents in development environments
* Dump and restore databases

To install the cf CLI MySQL plugin, run the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf install-plugin -r "CF-Community" mysql-plugin

### <a id="desktop"></a> Use Desktop Tools

You can connect your MySQL for PCF databases to a desktop tool, such as MySQL Workbench
or Sequel Pro, if you have the credentials for your MySQL service instance.

If you do not have credentials for your MySQL service instance, follow the procedure in
[Create Read-only Access Credentials](././customize-access.html).

To connect your databases to a desktop tool do the following:

1. To retrieve the credentials from your MySQL service instance service key, run the following
command:

    ```
    cf service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE MYSQL-SERVICE-KEY
    ```
    Where:
      * `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your service instance.
      * `KEY-NAME` is the name of your service key.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
      $ cf service-key mydb mykey1<br>
      {
        "hostname": "q-n3s3y1.q-g693.bosh",
        "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql<span>://</span>q-n3s3y1.q-g693.bosh:3306/service_instance_db?user=6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c\u0026password=a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa\u0026=true",
        "name": "service\_instance\_db",
        "password": "a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa",
        "port": 3306,
        "uri": "mysql<span>://</span>6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c:a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa<span>@</span>q-n3s3y1.q-g693.bosh:3306/service_instance_db?reconnect=true",
        "username": "6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c"
      }
    </pre>

1. Record the values for the following:
    * `hostname`
    * `name`
    * `password`
    * `port`
    * `username`

1. Configure an SSH tunnel using the values for `hostname` and `port` that you recorded in the above step.
   For information on configuring an SSH tunnel,
   see [Configure Your SSH Tunnel](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html#ssh-tunnel).

1. Configure a connection in your desktop tool using the values for `hostname`, `name`, `password`, `port`, and `username` that you recorded in the above step.
