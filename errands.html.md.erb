This topic describes how to use the BOSH CLI to run service broker
errands.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Errands can manage service brokers and run mass operations on service
instances created by brokers. For instructions about running errands,
see [Run an Errand](#errand) below.

<%= vars.product_full %> supports the following errands:

+ [find-deprecated-bindings](#find-deprecated-bindings)
+ [smoke-tests](#smoke-tests)
+ [upgrade-all-service-instances](#upgrade-all-service-instances)
+ [register-broker](#register-broker)
+ [delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker](#delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker)


## <a id="errand"></a> Run an Errand


To run an errand:

1. View the BOSH deployment name for your MySQL service broker by running:

    ```
    bosh deployments
    ```

1. Run an errand:

    ```
    bosh -d pivotal-mysql-GUID run-errand ERRAND-NAME
    ```

    Where:
    + `pivotal-mysql-GUID` is the BOSH deployment name for your MySQL service broker.
    + `ERRAND-NAME` is the name of the errand you want to run.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -d pivotal-mysql-e3ddd36247fe5b923caf run-errand deregister-broker</pre>



## <a id="find-deprecated-bindings"></a>find-deprecated-bindings

The `find-deprecated-bindings` errand lists app bindings and service keys that are deprecated in
<%= vars.platform_name %> v<%= vars.current_minor_version %>.
These bindings are deprecated because they do not require TLS.
The errand exits whether or not a deprecated binding is found.

Pivotal recommends that operators configure bindings to require TLS. For instructions about
configuring TLS, see [Configure TLS](/install-config.html#security).


See below example of the errand output:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -d pivotal-mysql-e3ddd36247fe5b923caf run-errand find-deprecated-bindings
Using environment '10.0.0.5' as client 'ops_manager'

Using deployment 'pivotal-mysql-e3ddd36247fe5b923caf'

## <a id="smoke-tests"></a>smoke-tests

This errand validates that the service broker has been installed
and configured correctly. It can also create and
remove service instances.

If this errand runs successfully, <%= vars.product_short %> is
installed successfully.

<!-- The below partial is in https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials -->

### <a id="upgrade-all-service-instances"></a>upgrade-all-service-instances

<%= partial '../../p-mysql/partials/services-tshoot/tshoot-tech-upgrade-all' %>

For more information, see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>](upgrade.html#upgrade-instances).

<%= partial '../../p-mysql/partials/services-tshoot/tshoot-tech-register-broker' %>


## <a id="delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker"></a>delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker


Ops Manager runs this errand only when deleting <%= vars.product_short %>.
Running this errand removes all service instances and their data.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Pivotal recommends using extreme caution
  when running this errand.
  You should only use it when you want to destroy all of the on-demand service instances and
  deregister the broker from <%= vars.platform_name %>.
</p>

This errand does the following:

1. Disables service access to the service offering for all orgs and spaces. The errand disables service
access to ensure that new instances cannot be provisioned during the lifetime of the errand.
1. Unbinds all apps from the service instances.
1. Deletes all service instances sequentially. Each service instance deletion includes:
  1. Running any pre-delete errands
  1. Deleting the BOSH deployment of the service instance
  1. Checking for instance deletion failure, which results in the errand failing immediately
1. Determines whether any instances have been created while the errand was running.
If new instances are detected, the errand returns an error.
In this case, Pivotal recommends running the errand again.
1. Deregisters the broker from <%= vars.platform_name %>.
