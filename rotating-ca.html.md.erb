<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to rotate certificate authority (CA) certificates. If you are using TLS for MySQL for PCF, you provided a CA certificate to BOSH CredHub when performing the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html). Operators must rotate these CA certificates before they expire or if they are compromised. 

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not attempt to rotate a CA certificate on your own.
Contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io">Pivotal Support</a>
and perform the following procedures with their help.</p>

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

To rotate CA certificates, you must do the following:

1. [Confirm Certificate Expiration Dates](#expire)
1. [Add a New CA Certificate](#add)
1. [Regenerate Internal Certificates](#regenerate)
1. [Rebind Your App](#rebind)
1. [Remove Old the CA Certificate](#remove)


##<a id='prereq'></a> Prerequisite

Before you rotate your CA certificates, you must obtain your `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`
from the BOSH Director tile. See [Find the CredHub Credentials in Ops Manager](./prepare-tls.html#credhub-creds).

##<a id='expire'></a> Confirm Certificate Expiration Dates

<!-- The steps require copy and pasting some steps below. Should I just add them here and just reference the procedure in the later sections? Fix example esp signed by and signs. what are the other cert names? can you just list all of the cersts? or rub get all instead, but how would your know which one is MySQL Add somewhere to 
validate the expiration date changed after the procedure-->

You must rotate your CA certificate and internal certificates before they expire. 
To view the expiration dates for certificates, do the following: 

1. Log in to CredHub by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME \
    --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` in [Prerequisite](#prereq), above.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` in [Prerequisite](#prereq), above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>
    
1. View the expiration date of your certificates by running the following command:

    ```
    curl 'https://BOSH-DIRECTOR/api/v1/certificates?name=%2FCERTIFCATE-NAME' -X GET \
    -H 'authorization: bearer $(credhub --token)' \
    -H 'accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
    ```
    Where `CERTIFICATE-NAME` is the name of your certificate.<br><br>
    
    For example: 
                                          
    <pre class="terminal">$ curl 'https://BOSH-DIRECTOR/api/v1/certificates?name=%2F/services/tls_ca' -X GET \
      -H 'authorization: bearer $(credhub --token)' \
      -H 'accept: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
      
      
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 334

    {
      "certificates" : [ {
        "name" : "/services/tls_ca",
        "id" : "6aa7b6cf-e216-49ad-8ac9-6d3af1bbd8ef",
        "versions" : [ {
          "expiry_date" : "2019-02-01T20:37:52Z",
          "id" : "32d2fa41-3020-4df5-9276-23961e4be054",
          "transitional" : false
        } ],
        "signed_by" : "/testCa",
        "signs" : [ "/cert1", "/cert2" ]
      } ]
    }</pre>


## <a id='regenerate-cert'></a> Regenerate and Add the New CA Certificate

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure involves restarting
all of the VMs in your PCF deployment to apply a CA certificate. The
operation can take a long time to complete.</p>

To regenerate and add the CA Certificate to Ops Manager, do the following:

1. To log in to the Ops Manager VM, do the following procedures:
    1. To gather the information needed to log in to the BOSH Director VM, 
        see [Gather Credential and IP Address Information](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather).
    1. To log in to the Ops Manager VM, see [Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. From the Ops Manager VM, to set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your BOSH
CredHub server, run the following: 

    ```
    credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
  Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM you recorded in step 1.a above.
  <br><br>
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
  </pre>

1. To log in to CredHub, run the following:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:<br>
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` in [Prerequisite](#prereq), above.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` in [Prerequisite](#prereq), above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre>
  
1. To generate a CA certificate or provide an existing one, do one of the following:
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Your PCF deployment can have
  multiple CA certificates.
   Pivotal recommends using a dedicated CA certificate for services.</p>
    * If you do not have a CA certificate, to generate a CA certificate run the following:
    
        ```
        credhub regenerate --name="/services/tls_ca" 
        ```  
    * If you have an existing CA certificate that you want to use, create
    a new file called `root.pem` with the contents of the certificate.
    Then run the following command:
    
        ```
        credhub set \
            --name="/services/tls_ca" \
            --type="certificate" \
            --certificate=PEM-PATH/root.pem \
            --private=CERT-KEY...
        ```
      Where:
      * `PEM-PATH` is the path to the `root.pem` file.
      * `CERT-KEY` is the private key for the certificate.
1. To extract and print the `certificate` portion from the CA certificate,
run the following command:

    ```
    bosh int <(credhub get \
    --name=/services/tls_ca) \
    --path /value/certificate
    ```

1. Copy the output.
1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and select the BOSH Director tile.
Click **Security**.
1. Append the contents of the new CA certificate to the old CA certificate under **Trusted Certificates**. Do not remove the old CA certificate. Click **Save**.
9. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**.
This restarts all the VMs in your PCF deployment and applies your CA certificate. 

## <a id="regenerate"></a> Regenerate Internal Certificates

To regenerate your internal certificates and redeploy your service instances, follow the procedure below:

1. To log in to CredHub, run the following:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME \
    --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` in [Prerequisite](#prereq), above.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` in [Prerequisite](#prereq), above.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789
    </pre> 
    
1. To regenerate all certificates signed by the old CA certificate, run the following

    ```
    curl "https://BOSH-DIRECTOR/api/v1/bulk-regenerate"" -X POST \
    -d '{ "signed_by": "/services/tls_ca" }'\
    -H "authorization: bearer $(credhub --token)"\
    -H 'content-type: application/json'
    ```
    Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM. 
    
1. To redeploy all service instances with the new certificates, run the following: 

    ```
    bosh -d p-mysql-GUID run-errand upgrade-all-service-instances  
    ```
    Where `pivotal-mysql-GUID` is the BOSH deployment name for your MySQL service broker.


## <a id='rebind'></a> Rebind Your App
If your apps do not use the trusted store to validate server certificates, developers must re-bind apps to the service instance to receive the updated CA certificate. Apps not written in Java and Spring do not use the trusted store.

If you are rotating your CA certificate because it was compromised, you must remove your old CA certificate before rebinding your app. If you have not removed your old CA certificate, see [Remove Old the CA Certificate](#remove) below.

To re-bind your app, do the following:

1. To stop your app, run the following command:
	
	```	
	cf stop YOUR-APP
	```
	Where `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app. 
	
1. To unbind your app from the service instance, run the following command:
	
	```
	cf unbind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	```
	Where:
	+ `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app.
	+ `YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your service instance.
	
1. To re-bind your app to the service instance, run the following command:

	```
	cf bind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	```
	Where:
	+ `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app.
	+ `YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your service instance.
1. To restage your app, run the following command:
	
	```
	cf restage YOUR-APP
	```
	Where `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app. 

                                   
## <a id="remove"></a> Remove Old the CA Certificate

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure involves restarting
	all of the VMs in your PCF deployment to apply a CA certificate. The
	operation can take a long time to complete.</p>

After your apps have reconnected to service instances with certificates generated by the new CA, do the following to remove the old CA certificate:

1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click the BOSH Director tile. Click **Security**.

1. Remove the old CA certificate in Trusted Certificates and click **Save**.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager and click **Apply Changes**. This restarts all the VMs in your deployment.   

1. If you are rotating your CA certificate because it was compromised, you must rebind your apps to update the CA certificate. See [Rebind Your App](#rebind) above.
