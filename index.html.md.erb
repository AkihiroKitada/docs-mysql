This guide describes setting up and using MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) as an on-demand service.

<p class="note warning"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This version is a pre-release and is not intended for production use.</p>

## <a id='AboutTile'></a>About MySQL for PCF

MySQL for PCF enables PCF app developers to provision and use a MySQL database with a
single command.

MySQL for PCF v2.0 introduces a new type of service, an *on-demand* service. MySQL for PCF v2.0 replaces the *pre-provisioned* service
that was in the v1.x series.

This table summarizes the main differences between the two:

   <td>New for v2.0</td>

   <th>Pre-Provisioned Service</th>

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview ##

The MySQL for PCF product delivers dedicated instances on demand, "Database as a Service", to Cloud Foundry users. 
When installed, the tile deploys and maintains a single Service Broker that is responsible for Cloud Foundry integration.
The service is configured with sane defaults, following the principle of least surprise for a general-use relational database service.
