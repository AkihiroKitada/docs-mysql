<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v2.4.x version, upgrade to the latest v2.4.x version
before upgrading to the latest v2.5.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths, see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Before Upgrading: </strong> All bindings created using MySQL for PCF v2.3 or earlier use IP addresses. Any bindings created using v2.3 or earlier <strong>must be re-created</strong> before upgrading to v2.5, which requires DNS-based bindings. For more information, see [MySQL for PCF Errands](errands.html#find-deprecated-bindings).

## <a id="252"></a>v2.5.2

**Release Date:**  December 20, 2018

#### Bindings Use DNS

This release completes the transition from bindings via IP addresses to DNS hostnames. This lays the foundation for coming improvements, and also enables Highly Available Clusters (HA Clusters).

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### Highly Available Clusters On-Demand

MySQL for PCF now supports **three deployment topologies**. In addition to Single Node and Leader-Follower, Operators can now offer a Highly Available Cluster service plan. For information on how to configure a HA Cluster plan, see [Configure Service Plans](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html#active) option. For information on availability criteria for each topology, see [Availability Options](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/availability-options.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING! </strong> Highly available clusters are <strong>beta</strong> in v2.5.</p>

While in **beta**, the following limitations exist:
- Operators are required to impose a plan quota that is no more than five instances.
- Restoring from backups is a manual process. For more information, see [Restore an HA Cluster Instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/backup-and-restore.html#runHA).
- No encryption at rest for HA clusters.

**Highly Available Clusters are for Advanced Use Cases Only**

In addition to higher infrastructure cost, Galera clusters introduce some significant limitations that are different from running Single-Node or Leader-Follower MySQL. For more information, see [High Availability Limitations](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/index.html#limitations).

Due to these limitations, HA Clusters are **not recommended for sharing between multiple users/applications**. Service instance sharing is **disabled** for HA Clusters. If necessary, you can still share by creating User Provided Service Instances (UPSI). For more information, see [User Provided Service Instances](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html).

Choose HA Clusters only when the availability criteria that Leader-Follower provides is not sufficient for your application.

**Features of Highly Available Clusters**

- Highly Available clusters are provisioned on-demand.
- Monitoring, diagnostics, and backups are performed from a **jumpbox VM**. For information on how to configure this VM, see [Configure Service Plans](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html#active).
	- The jumpbox VM runs a replication canary that continuously tests replication health between cluster nodes. For more information, see [Replication Canary](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/monitor.html#repcanary).
	- Operators can run diagnostics (e.g., disk usage) on an HA cluster by running the `mysql-diag` script on the jumpbox VM. For more information, see [Running mysql-diag](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/mysql-diag.html).
	- Like Single Node and Leader-Follower, configuring automatic backups is required. For information on how to configure automated backups, see [Configure Backups](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html#backups). For how to perform a manual backup and restore, see [Backing Up and Restoring On-Demand MySQL for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-5/backup-and-restore.html).
- Developers can view a dashboard to see the state of each node in the HA cluster. For more information, see [Monitor Node Health Using the Dashboard](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-5/monitor-health.html#dashboard).
- Connections to the Highly Available cluster


#### Improvements for Developers
- Developers no longer need to perform manual steps to enable TLS connections to their service instances.
- Developers can see metrics for their service instances via the [CF CLI Log Cache plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache-cli).

#### Improvements for Operators
- Operators can run the `find-deprecated-bindings` BOSH errand to discover service instances with outdated service bindings and service keys. For more information, see [MySQL for PCF Errands](errands.html#find-deprecated-bindings).
- Operators can configure up to nine service plans in the tile.
- Operators can mark service plans as **free** or **paid** so that developer can be aware of costs associated with certain service plans.
- Operators can configure the default idle timeout for connections to a service instance to allow compliance with CIS security benchmarks.
