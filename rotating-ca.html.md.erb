This topic describes how to rotate certificate authority (CA) certificates. If you are using TLS for MySQL for PCF, you provided a CA certificate to BOSH CredHub when performing the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html). Operators must rotate these CA certificates before they expire or if they are compromised.
