## <a id="monitoring-8.14.0"></a>mysql-monitoring v8.14.0

- **Bug fix:** `mysql-diag` now fails quickly when VMs in the cluster aren't available
- **Bug fix:** replication-canary causes high CPU spikes because it overwrites logs files rather than appends

## <a id="monitoring-8.13.0"></a>mysql-monitoring v8.13.0

- **New:** Added metrics that represent disk usage as percentages.
           This makes it easier to alert on disk usage without knowing the deployment disk size.
           For more information, see the [Persistent and Ephemeral Disk Used](monitoring-mysql.html#disk-free).
