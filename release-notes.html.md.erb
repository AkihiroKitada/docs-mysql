## <a id="2-10-2"></a> v2.10.2

**Release Date: March 11, 2021**

New features and changes in this release:

+ **Support Instance Profiles for backups to S3:**
  A radio button on the **Backups** pane allows for backups to Amazon S3 without
  using static credentials.
  For more information, see
  [Back Up to Amazon S3 with Instance Profile](automated-backup.html#instance-profile).

+ **Avoid filling up the Persistent Disk with Binary Logs:**
  A checkbox restricts the space that binary logs can use on the persistent disk.
  For databases with a high transaction rate, this change prevents database failures due
  to the disk running out of space.
  For more information,
  see [Limit binary log disk use to 33% of disk capacity](./install-config.html#mysql)
  in _Installing and Configuring_.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

+ **ADBR does not show error "Status during Restore Operation"**:
  Previously, the ADBR plugin showed an error status during a restore when the database was unavailable.
  Now, the ADBR plugin reports the restore status as being in progress.

## <a id="2-10-0"></a> v2.10.0

**Release Date: December 8, 2020**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>:
Before you upgrade to <%= vars.product_full %> v2.10, make sure that
your apps support connecting to the MySQL database using TLS v1.2.
This might require updating the MySQL connector.
For example, if you are using MySQL Connector/J,
use MySQL Connector/J v8.0.8 or later or v5.1.44 or later.
</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ **External access to the MySQL database through Service-Gateway:** By enabling service-gateway access,
  operators and developers can allow MySQL service instances to be accessed from outside
  <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> platform.
  For more information, see [About Service-Gateway Access](./service-gateway-access.html).

+ **Option to restrict MySQL client connections to TLS v1.2:** When TLS is enabled,
  operators can choose to enforce TLS v1.2 as the minimum TLS version for client connections.
  Connections that use the TLS v1.1 protocol or older are then rejected by the MySQL server.

+ **Backup artifacts are organized under subfolders in external storage:** Previously, the Application
  Developer Backup and Restore (ADBR) feature stored backup artifacts in the root directory in external storage.
  For easier navigation, backup artifacts are now stored under
  `p.mysql > service-instance_GUID > yyyy > mm > dd`.
  Old backup artifacts stored in the root directory can still be accessed through the cf CLI
  using the adbr plugin.

+ **<%= vars.single_leader_plan %> GA:** The <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> feature is officially generally available in
  this release. There have been no changes to the feature since v2.9.1.

+ **Percona Server:** Upgraded to v5.7.31–34.

+ **Percona XtraDB Cluster:** Upgraded to v5.7.31–34.
