Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v2.3.x version, upgrade to the latest v2.3.x version
before upgrading to the latest v2.4.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths, see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>MySQL for PCF v2.4.0 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
You must verify that you have the Xenial stemcell, and, if necessary, download and import it into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library before deploying MySQL for PCF v2.4.0.
This might break automations you have set up to update MySQL for PCF deployments that used Trusty stemcells.
For instructions on verifying the stemcell, see <a href="./install-config.html#stemcell"> Verify Stemcell Version and Apply All Changes</a>.
To download the Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network, go to <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial"> Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)</a>.

## <a id="242"></a>v2.4.2

**Release Date: December 3, 2018**

### Known Issues

There are no known issues for this release.

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fixes:

* Critical [CVE-2018-15759: On Demand Services SDK Timing Attack Vulnerability](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15759)
* Open connections to the MySQL database are now severed immediately upon deletion of a binding or service key.

### Fixed Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* Fixes an issue where smoke tests fail if Service Plan Access is set to manual.
* An attempt to install MySQL for PCF 2.4 with an incompatible version of PCF will fail fast when the tile is staged, rather than when MySQL smoke tests are run.

### Improvements

Improvements and other changes in this release:

* Credentials for doing backups have been removed from the MySQL broker BOSH manifest, and are now stored securely in CredHub.
* The `find-non-tls-bindings` BOSH errand has been enhanced to also search for IP-based bindings and service keys. The errand has been renamed to `find-deprecated-bindings`. 
* The `find-deprecated-bindings` BOSH errand has clearer error messaging to more easily determine the cause of failure.
* The AWS S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key fields in the Backups configuration pane in Ops Manager are no longer shown in plaintext.

## <a id="240"></a>v2.4.0

**Release Date:**  September 24, 2018

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

**Auto-healing**

* A leader VM that was resurrected by BOSH returns in read/write mode if no failover was triggered.
  This removes the requirement for operators to run the `configure-leader-follower` BOSH errand after resurrection.

**Improvements due to BOSH DNS**

<p class="note warning"><strong> Important:</strong> For your app to reliably connect to MySQL over BOSH DNS,
you must make sure that your app, or the MySQL client library that the app uses,
retries in the case of DNS timeouts.</p>

* Developers now connect to a service instance using its BOSH DNS hostname,
  instead of over IPs as in MySQL for PCF v2.3.

* The leader-follower failover process no longer requires developers to rebind their apps to the service instance.

To take advantage of the BOSH DNS improvments, you must do the following:

1. Upgrade the MySQL instances, see <a href="./upgrade.html#upgrade-instances">Upgrade MySQL Instances</a>.

2. Rebind the apps, see <a href="./use.html#bind">Bind a Service Instance to Your App</a>.

**Service Instance Sharing**

* Developers can share their service instance across different orgs and spaces.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Service instance sharing is a beta feature in PCF v2.2
       and a GA feature in PCF v2.3. 
       For information about service instance sharing,
       see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html">Sharing Service Instances</a>.

**Encryption at Rest**

* MySQL for PCF v2 enables integration with commercial vendors for full-disk encryption at rest. This integration has been certified with the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/vormetric-transparent-encryption/">Thales Vormetric plugin</a>.

**Improvements for Developers**

* Clearer messaging to developers trying to bind to a service instance with TLS disabled when the operator has enforced TLS.

**Improvements for Operators**

* BOSH errands run faster, saving operators time during upgrades and installation.
* Developers are prevented from binding or updating a service that is two or more versions older than the service broker.
* Operators can configure the timeout for the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand to support large deployments.
* Operators can see apps with outdated bindings by running the `find-deprecated-bindings` BOSH errand.

**Improvements to Smoke Tests**

* Operators can run smoke tests on a specific service instance to determine its health.

### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fixes:

* Service bindings no longer have unnecessary access to the MySQL `sys` database.

### Fixed Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* Placement of service instance VMs is now randomized across all selected AZs for its plan, reducing the magnitude of an outage caused by an AZ failure.
* The `find-non-tls-bindings` BOSH errand on the service broker still works when the installed PCF version has Credhub, but secure service credentials is not enabled.
* If the `find-non-tls-bindings` errand fails, the operator sees better messaging for the cause of the error.
* Smoke tests no longer fail on an initial install of the tile when Service Plan Access is set to Manual.
