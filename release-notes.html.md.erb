Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.

upgrade to the latest v1.7.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.8.x version.

  instances with replication metrics. For more information, see [About Leader-Follower](./about-leader-follower.html).

* This version of the MySQL for PCF can only be installed in an Ops Manager v1.12 or later environment.
