title: Using MySQL for PCF
owner: MySQL
---

This topic provides instructions for developers using the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry v2 service for their Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) apps. MySQL provides a relational database for apps and devices.

These procedures use the Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI). You can also use [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html) to perform the same tasks using a graphical UI.

For general information, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html). 

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To use MySQL for PCF v2 with your PCF apps, you need:

* A PCF installation with [MySQL for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql) installed and listed in the [Marketplace](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/#instances)
* A [Space Developer](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#roles) or Admin account on the PCF installation
* A local machine with the following installed:
   - a browser
   - a shell
   - the [Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) (cf CLI)
   - the Linux [watch](http://www.linfo.org/watch.html) command
* To [log into](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) the org and space containing your app

## <a id='process'></a>The Create-Bind Process

Because every app and service in PCF is scoped to a [space](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#spaces), an app can only use a service if an instance of the service exists in the same space. 

To use MySQL in a PCF app:

1. Use the [cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) or [Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/console-login.html) to log into the org and space that contains the app.

1. Make sure an instance of the MySQL for PCF service exists in the same space as the app.
   - If the space does not already have a MySQL for PCF instance, [create](#create) one.
   - If the space already has a MySQL for PCF instance, you can [bind](#bind) your app to the existing instance or create a new instance to bind to your app.

2. [Bind](#bind) the app to the MySQL for PCF service instance, to enable the app to use MySQL.

## <a id='marketplace'></a>Confirm Service Availability

For an app to use a service, 1) the service must be available in the Marketplace for its space and 2) an instance of the service must exist in its space.

You can confirm both of these using the cf CLI as follows.

1. To find out if a MySQL for PCF v2 service is available in the Marketplace:
   1. Enter `cf marketplace`
   1. If the output lists `p.mysql` in the `service` column, on-demand MySQL for PCF is available. If it is not available, ask your operator to install it.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service             plans          description
    [...]
    p.mysql             db-small       Dedicated instances of MySQL service to provide a relational database
    [...]
    </pre>

1. To confirm that a MySQL for PCF v2 instance is running in the space
    1. Enter `cf services`
    1. Any `p.mysql` listings in the `service` column are service instances of on-demand MySQL in the space.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf services
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service     plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql     db-small                  create succeeded
    </pre>
    You can [bind](#bind) your app to an existing instance or [create](#create) a new instance to bind to your app.

## <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

Unlike pre-provisioned services, on-demand services are created asynchronously, not immediately. The `watch` command shows you when your service instance is ready to bind and use.

To create an instance of the MySQL for PCF v2 service, run `cf create-service`:

1. Enter `cf create-service p.mysql db-small SERVICE_INSTANCE`

    Where `SERVICE_INSTANCE` is a name you choose to identify the service instance. This name will appear under `service` \[sic\] in output from `cf services`.

1. Enter `watch cf services` and wait for the `last operation` for your instance to show as `create succeeded`. 

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf create-service p.mysql db-small my-instance<br>
    Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK<br>
   $ watch cf services<br>
    Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    name          service       plan        bound apps    last operation
    my-instance   p.mysql       db-small                  create succeeded
</pre>

    If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting Instances](./troubleshoot-instances.html).

## <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind it to a service instance. Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

To bind an app to a MySQL instance run `$ cf bind-service`.

1. Enter `cf bind-service APP SERVICE_INSTANCE`

    Where `APP` is the app you want to use the MySQL service instance and `SERVICE_INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
    Binding service mydb to my-app in org my-org / space test as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    TIP: Use 'cf push' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

## <a id="call"></a>Use the MySQL Service in Your App

To access the MySQL service from your app:

1. Run `cf env APP_NAME` with the name of the app bound to the MySQL for PCF instance.

1. In the output, note the connection strings listed in the `VCAP_SERVICES` > `credentials` object for the app.

1. In your app code, call the MySQL service using the connection strings.

For how to code your app to use MySQL messaging, see **About Using Pivotal MySQL** > **Client Documentation** in the [MySQL documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql).

## <a id="update"></a>Update to a Larger Service Instance

As applications and their databases grow, it may be necessary to update the service instance to a larger plan.

1. Enter `cf update-service -p PLAN`

    Where `PLAN` is the plan you want to upgrade the service instance to.

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf update-service -p db-large
</pre>

Doing so does not require a rebinding of your application. However, while the instance is being migrated to a new service instance
the database will be unavailable for several minutes.

## <a id="unbind"></a>Unbind a Service Instance to Your App

To stop an app from using a service it no longer needs, unbind it from the service instance using `cf unbind-service`.

1. Enter `cf unbind-service APP SERVICE_INSTANCE`

    Where `APP` is the app you want to stop using the MySQL service instance and `SERVICE_INSTANCE` is the name you supplied when you ran `cf create-service`.

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf unbind-service my-app my-instance<br>
    Unbinding app my-app from service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
</pre>

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete a Service Instance

To delete a service instance, run `cf delete-service`.

1. Enter `cf delete-service SERVICE_INSTANCE`

    Where `SERVICE_INSTANCE` is the name of the service to delete.

    <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf delete-service my-instance<br>
    Are you sure you want to delete the service my-instance ? y
    Deleting service my-service in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
</pre>

1. Enter `watch cf service SERVICE_INSTANCE` and wait for a `Service instance not found` error indicating that the instance no longer exists.

You cannot delete a service instance that an app is bound to.
