**Release Date: XX X, XXX**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ When upgrading from MySQL for PCF v2.5 to v2.6, internal certificates and
certificate authorities automatically rotate when
an operator runs `upgrade-all-service-instances`. The new certificates and CAs do
not expire for 5 years. 
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you do not run <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code>
    your certificates can expire. This can cause issues with backups, services bindings, and highly available clusters. </p>

+ Galera (soon to be renamed to HA Clusters) now compatible with plug-ins for Encryption at Rest

+ Weâ€™ve made improvements to better handle empty data directory on initialization

+ We've made significant progress in moving to BPM (BOSH Process Manager). This
is a significant departure from how jobs are launched

+ We've configured new MySQL properties to improve performance of Galera plans

+ Bumped the Percona Server version to v5.7.24-26

+ Bumped the Golang version to 1.12.x

### Resolved Issues
