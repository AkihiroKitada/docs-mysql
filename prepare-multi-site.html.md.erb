This topic provides instructions to operators about how to prepare foundations for
<%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> using <%= vars.product_name %>.

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

<!-- Quick reasons why you would want to use this and what it is. Super summary of
the About page-->

For more information about multi-site architecture,
see [About <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./about-multi-site.html).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> can be configured for <%= vars.product_name %>, you must
confirm that you have done the following:

1. Created two PCF foundations with identical release versions.
The configurations and capacities of the two foundations should be as similar as possible.

1. Set up <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> disaster recovery plan for your foundations, using one of the following:
      + **Active-Passive:** Pivotal recommends this topology for most apps.
      If you use active-passive disaster recovery plan, you must create a primary foundation and a secondary foundation.
      For more information, see [Active-Passive Topology](./about-multi-site.html#active-passive).
      + **Active-Active:** Pivotal recommends this topology for apps with critical workloads
      that require high app uptime. If you use active-active typology, you must create two primary foundations.
      For more information, see [Active-Active Topology](./about-multi-site.html#active-active).

1. Deployed both foundations on a single flat network. For example, the leader and follower nodes must be
able to connect to each other on their respective IP addresses. You must ensure that the CIDR ranges for the leader
and follower nodes do not overlap.

1. Configured a global DNS load balancer to point to the two PCF foundations
and their local load balancers.
See [Configure Your GLB](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/plan/global-dns-lb.html#configure-glb).

##<a id='enable'></a> Enable <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>

After two PCF foundations are created, you can enable <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> by
doing the following:

1. Configure networking rules.
See [Required Networking Rules for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>](./about.html#multi-site-ports).

1. Enable TLS for both foundations. When you paste the contents of your TLS CA certificate in [Preparing for TLS](./prepare-tls.html), paste both TLS CA certificates as shown below:

    ![On the Security pane in the MySQL tile, a TLS CA certificate for the two different foundation are in the Trusted Certificates field.](./images/multi-site-ca.png)

1. Configure a <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> plan on both foundations. See
[Configure Service Plans](./install-config.html#active).
