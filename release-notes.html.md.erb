Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line, then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line. For example, if you use an older v2.5
.x version, upgrade to the latest v2.5.x version before upgrading to the latest v2.6.x version.

## <a id="2-6-0"></a> v2.6.0

**Release Date: June 19, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ When you upgrade to MySQL for PCF v2.6, MySQL for PCF automatically rotates internal certificates for single node and leader-follower service instances. The new certificates do not expire for 5 years. MySQL for PCF does not automatically rotate TLS certificates or certificates for HA cluster service instances during upgrades.
  For more information, see [Rotating Certificates](./rotating-ca.html).
  <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If your internal certificates expire, service bindings and backups fail. </p>

+ HA cluster plans are compatible with plugins for Encryption at Rest.

+ Handling is improved for empty data directories on initialization.

+ MySQL for PCF relies significantly more on bpm (BOSH Process Manager) for how it launches jobs.
  For general information about bpm, see [bpm](https://bosh.io/docs/bpm/bpm/) in the BOSH documentation.

+ New MySQL property configurations improve performance of HA cluster plans.

+ The Percona Server version is updated to v5.7.24-26.

+ The golang version is updated to v1.12.x.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

+ Java apps can use HA cluster plans with or without enabling TLS.
