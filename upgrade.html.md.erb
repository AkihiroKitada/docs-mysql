title: Upgrading MySQL for PCF
owner: MySQL

This topic explains how to upgrade the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service and existing service instances.
It also explains the service interruptions that can result from service changes and upgrades and from failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level.

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change: </strong>MySQL for PCF v2.4.0 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
You must verify that you have the Xenial stemcell, and, if necessary, download and import it into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library before deploying MySQL for PCF v2.4.0.
This might break automations you have set up to update MySQL for PCF deployments that used Trusty stemcells.
For instructions on verifying the stemcell, see <a href="./install-config.html#stemcell"> Verify Stemcell Version and Apply All Changes</a>.
To download the Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network, go to <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial"> Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)</a>.
</p>

## <a id="update-addons"></a>Update Add-ons to Run with Xenial Stemcell

MySQL for PCF v2.4.0 and later requires a Xenial stemcell.
If you are using any of the following BOSH add-ons with your PCF deployment,
you must update the add-on definition to include the Xenial stemcell before you deploy MySQL for PCF v2.4.0:

+ File Integrity Monitoring for PCF Add-on. For update instructions, see [Updating FIM Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/updating-for-xenial.html).
+ ClamAV for PCF Add-on. For update instructions, see [Updating ClamAV Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus/updating-for-xenial.html).
+ IPsec for PCF Add-on. For update instructions, see [Updating IPsec Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/updating-for-xenial.html).


## <a id="upgrade-service"></a>Upgrade MySQL for PCF

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  Before upgrading to the next version of MySQL for PCF,
run the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand to make sure that
all your service instances are upgraded to your current version.<br>
For more information, see <a href="./troubleshoot.html#upgrade-all">Upgrade All Service Instances</a>.</p>

To upgrade the MySQL for PCF service, you follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install the service for the first time.
Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. To perform an upgrade:

1. Review the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial),
and import it into the Ops Manager Stemcell Library. For instructions, see [Verify Stemcell Version and Apply All Changes](./install-config.html#stemcell).

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **MySQL for PCF**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **MySQL for PCF** tile to review its configuration panes. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Dashboard and do the following to complete the installation:

    1. If you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
    For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).<br><br>
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

Upgrading the MySQL for PCF service and service instances can temporarily interrupt
the service.
For more information, see [Service Interruptions](#interruptions) below.

## <a id="upgrade-instances"></a>Upgrade MySQL Instances

After upgrading the MySQL for PCF service, you must upgrade existing service instances
to be in sync with the new version of the service.
Developers cannot create new bindings to a service instance that has not been upgraded.

To upgrade existing service instances, do one of the following:

- **Operators** <br><br>
	Run the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand using the following command:

	```
	bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand upgrade-all-service-instances
	```
	<br>
- **Operators or developers** <br><br>
To upgrade existing service instances individually, run the `cf update-service` command.
For more information about this command, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service).
<br><br>
- **Developers** <br><br>
After upgrade to MySQL for PCF v2.4, developers can take advantage of BOSH DNS functionality
to facilitate failover in a leader-follower configuration. <br><br>To allow apps to automatically connect to a new leader, in the case
where a leader in a leader-follower pair fails, do the following:
	1. After upgrading to MySQL for PCF v2.4, unbind your apps. For instructions, see [Unbind an App from a Service Instance](./use.html#unbind).
	2. Rebind your apps. For instructions, see [Bind a Service Instance to Your App](./use.html#bind).
	3. If you use TLS, re-enable it. For instructions, see [Enable TLS](./using-tls.html#enable-tls).


## <a id="interruptions"></a>Service Interruptions

Service changes and upgrades and failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level can cause outages in the MySQL for PCF service, as described below.

Read this section if:

+ You are experiencing a service interruption and are wondering why.
+ You are planning to update or change a service instance and want to know if it might cause a service interruption.

### <a id='service-update'></a>Stemcell or Service Update

An operator updates a stemcell version or their version of MySQL for PCF.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> Apps lose access to the MySQL service while PCF updates the service instance they are bound to.
          The service should resume within 10–15 minutes.
- <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the update deploys successfully, apps reconnect automatically.

### <a id='change-plan'></a>Plan Change

A developer changes their service instance to provide a different service plan, using `cf update-service` or Apps Manager.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> Apps lose access to the MySQL service while PCF updates the service instance they are bound to.
          The service should resume within 10–15 minutes.
- <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the plan change deploys successfully, apps reconnect automatically.
