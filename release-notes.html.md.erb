## <a id="1-7-11"></a>1.7.11

We've discovered a rare condition where a MySQL cluster experiences a fault in replication that can result in some data loss. When this occurs, previous releases do not log the root cause of the bug. In order to best address this issue, version 1.7.11 contains significant additional telemetry and several defensive features which will account for the failure condition and prevent data loss.

<p class='note'><strong>If any of these protections activate, it is critical that you contact Pivotal support immediately.</strong> Support will work with you to determine the nature of the cluster's failure, and advise a suggested resolution. Additionally, contacting Support will provide us with evidence that will enable us to identify and address the root cause in the future.</p>

  - **Introducing the Replication Canary**

    We've included a new long-running monitor, the **Replication Canary**. The Replication Canary continually monitors the MySQL cluster, watching for instances in which cross-cluster replication has failed. It is enabled by default, and requires an e-mail address in the Advanced Options configuration pane.<br><br>

    In the event that replication has failed, the Canary performs two actions:

    - E-mail the Operator: Part of the Replication Canary's configuration is an e-mail address, which can be directed to any Operator e-mail address, or an escalation system similar to PagerDuty.
    - Deny Access: When replication has failed, the Replication Canary will automatically disable user and applications' ability to access the cluster via the Proxies.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: Due to the serious nature of a failure in replication, both behaviors are enabled by default. During configuration, you may elect to set the Replication Canary to notify-only mode, but this is not recommended.</p>

    - You **must** set the `Monitoring` job to 1 in the Resource Config pane, or the Replication Canary will not be enabled, regardless of configuration.
    - You **must** also confirm that the Elastic Runtime tile is properly configured to send e-mail. These settings are necessary for any standard Cloud Foundry configuration.
      - Ensure that the `Notifications` errand has been enabled.
      - Ensure that `SMTP Config` has been properly configured.

        If either of these are not set, configure and **Apply Changes** before deploying version 1.7.11.

    For more information about the Replication Canary, see the [monitoring documentation](monitoring-mysql.html#repcanary).

  - **Introducing the Interruptor**

    The MySQL nodes have new logic that, when enabled, will prevent a node from re-joining a cluster under certain conditions. This is a second level of protection against the possibility of data loss.<br><br>

    For more information about the Interruptor, see the [monitoring documentation](monitoring-mysql.html#interruptor).

  - **New feature**: Backing up all nodes

    In the Backups configuration pane, there's now an option to take backups from all MySQL nodes. This feature protects your users from data loss in the case that some nodes have different data than the others.
  - Logging Changes
    - MySQL job logs are kept local on the VM, in addition to sent to syslog if configured.
    - Binary logs are now enabled and rotated automatically by the system.
    - Plus a host of debug log changes have been added to aid in diagnosis efforts.
  - XA Transactions are now disallowed.
    - XA Transactions are not compatible with our HA technology.
  - Quota Enforcer is now configurable.
  - Maximum open file descriptors now default to 65K for large databases.
  - **Security fix:** Now includes MariaDB 10.0.23
    - Avoids a possible credential leak.

## <a id="1-5-0"></a>1.5.0

Release date: 08 March 2015

- **AWS support:** The clustered database service can now be deployed on Amazon Web Services from the Operations Manager Web UI.
  - Deployment is limited to a single Availability Zone. Look for multi-AZ in future releases.
  - Single availability zone is a limitation on AWS. Operations Manager on vSphere continues to support deployment to multiple availability zones.
  - The default instance type for the cluster nodes on AWS is m3.large.
  - All jobs are deployed with SSD for ephemeral and persistent disk.
- **IaaS agnostic**
  - The same product can be deployed to both AWS and vSphere
  - Precompiled packages are no longer included
  - MySQL for PCF 1.5.0 requires Operations Manager 1.4.0
- **New proxy tier**
  - Improved availability: We have entirely re-written the proxy to eliminate situations where clients could hang when a cluster node was unhealthy.
  - A dashboard that clearly displays node health in real time
- **Upgrade support:** This product can be automatically upgraded from version 1.3.2 or 1.4.0

**Known issues:**

* On AWS, this version supports deployments in the US-East region. Multi-region support is coming in a future release.
* The experimental HTTPS-only feature in Elastic Runtime 1.5 may cause issues with this version of the product. Full support for HTTPS-only traffic is coming in a future release.
* Note: BOSH Stemcell 2865.1 is required for installation on Ops Manager 1.5.x and above.

## <a id="1-4-0"></a>1.4.0

Release date: 22 December 2014

- **High Availability**: database server is now clustered and synchronously replicated using MariaDB Galera Cluster. A copy of each database resides on all cluster nodes, and writes to any database are replicated to all copies. All client connections are routed to a primary cluster node, and in the event of a node failure the proxy tier manages failover, routing client connections to a healthy cluster node. MySQL server, proxy, and broker jobs can all be scaled out horizontally for increased availability, eliminating single points of failure.
- **Improved logging and monitoring**: route-registration on the broker is now an independent process
- **Bug fix**: calculation of storage utilization for the purposes of quota enforcement when multiple apps are bound
- **Bug fix**: format of jdbcUrl connection string (found in VCAP_SERVICES on bind)

    ### Notes on High Availability ###

- When upgrading from an older version, applications must be rebound to take advantage of high availability features. To rebind: unbind your application from the service instance, bind it again, then restage your application. For more information see [Managing Service Instances with the CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html).
- Elimination of the proxy as a single point of failure requires configuration of an external load balancer to route connections to proxy instances. For details, see [Proxy Settings](./index.html#proxy).
- See [Known Issues](./known-issues.html).

## <a id="1-3-2"></a>1.3.2

Release date: 06 October 2014

- **Updated stemcell addresses bash-shellshock vulnerabilities**: resolves CVEs discussed [here](http://www.pivotal.io/security/CVE-2014-6271) and [here](http://www.pivotal.io/security/CVE-2014-7186).

## <a id="1-3-0"></a>1.3.0

- **Syslog forwarding**: Syslogs are now streamed to the same host and port configured in Elastic Runtime settings
- **Dynamic instance capacity management**: Previously operators had to manually configure the maximum number of service instances permitted by the server. This required manual calculation and a knowledge of required system headroom. Admins can now manage instance capacity simply by adjusting persistent disk allocated to mysql nodes. Remaining instance capacity is determined dynamically by subtracting a safe estimate for system headroom and reserved storage for provisioned instances.
- **Trusty stemcell**: Server and broker are now deployed on Ubuntu “Trusty” 14.04 LTS stemcells, providing improved security, performance, and a smaller resource footprint.
- **Least necessary privileges**: The MySQL service dashboard uses a new, limited permission OAuth scope to determine whether a user currently has access to a service instance. The dashboard no longer has full read access to a user’s account.
- **Precompiled packages**: Most packages have been precompiled for the targeted stemcell. This will lower initial deployment times, at the cost of a larger download.

## <a id="1-2-0"></a>1.2.0

- Product renamed to 'MySQL for Pivotal CF'
- Plan attributes are configurable: max storage per database, max concurrent connections per user, and max databases
- Plan name is determined dynamically based on configured storage quota
- Plan features include disclaimer that the service is not for production use
- Developers can SSO to a service dashboard that displays storage utilization
- Security fixes including updates to Rails
- Service broker is registered by URL (rather than by IP). Typically has the format `https://p-mysql.<cf-domain>`.
* Lifecycle errands are used to register the broker and run tests that verify the deployment.
* Improved logging in service broker

### The following components will be re-deployed:

* cf-mysql-broker
* mysql

### New components:

* broker-registrar
* broker-deregistrar
* acceptance-tests

## <a id="1-1-0"></a>1.1.0

* Updated the format of metadata fields in the broker catalog endpoint and added
additional fields. For more information, see Catalog Metadata.
* Updated Ruby to version 2.0.0p353 to fix a vulnerability in 1.9.3p448.
* Requests to delete a service instance or binding now get a 200 response with an empty
JSON body instead of a 204.
* The broker now returns a clear error when there is no more capacity for additional
instances during a provision request. The response has status code `507`. The
user-facing error message is "Service plan capacity has been reached."

### The following components will be re-deployed:
* cf-mysql-broker
* mysql
