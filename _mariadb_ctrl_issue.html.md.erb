- **Known Issue:** More than one `mariadb_ctrl` process can run at the same time.  
This can lead to:  
      - one `mariadb_ctrl` process killing another `mariadb_ctrl` process 
      - `mariadb_ctrl` processes waiting indefinitely for MySQl to start 
      - other issues when starting `mariadb_ctrl` processes
