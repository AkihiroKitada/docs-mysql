VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v<%= previous_version %>.x
version, upgrade to the latest v<%= previous_version %>.x version
before upgrading to the latest v<%= current_version %>.x version.

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ **Improved backup and restore workflow:**
Operators and developers can use the ApplicationDataBackupRestore (adbr) plugin
with the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to back up and
restore service instances.
For more information, see [Backing up and Restoring <%= vars.product_full %>](./backup-restore.html).

+ **A developer can change the backup schedule for an individual service instance using
an arbitrary parameter:**
For more information, see [Backup Schedule](./change-default.html#backup-schedule).

+ Each backup of any MySQL service instance now uses a unique encryption key.

+ When Secure copy protocol (SCP) is configured as the external storage to upload backups,
it now relies on SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
