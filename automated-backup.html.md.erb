<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure automated, physical backups for <%= vars.product_full %>.

Additionally, when they want, developers can create physical backups using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI)
or logical backups using `mysqldump`.
For more information about physical backups, see
[Backing Up and Restoring <%= vars.product_full %>](./backup-restore.html).
For more information about logical backups, see
[Backing Up and Restoring with mysqldump](./backup-mysqldump.html).

You can restore a physical backup by following the procedures in
[Restore a Service Instance](./backup-restore.html#restore).

## <a id="enable-backups"></a> About Configuring Automated Backups

You can configure <%= vars.product_short %> to automatically back up databases to external storage.
<%= vars.product_short %> backs up the entire data directory for each service instance.

<%= vars.product_short %> backs up your database on a schedule.
You configure this schedule with a cron expression.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Configuring a cron expression overrides the default schedule for your service instance.
  <br><br>
  Developers can override the default for their service instance.
  For more information, see <a href="./change-default.html#backup-schedule">Backup Schedule</a>.
</p>

To configure backups, follow the procedure for your external storage solution:

+ [Back Up Using SCP](#scp)
+ [Back Up to Amazon S3 or Ceph](#ceph-or-s3)
+ [Back Up to GCS](#gcs)
+ [Back Up to Azure Storage](#azure)

## <a id="scp"></a> Back Up Using SCP

Secure copy protocol (SCP) enables operators to use any storage solution
on the destination VM. This is the fastest method for backing up your database.

When you configure backups with SCP,
<%= vars.product_short %> runs an SCP command that uses SFTP to securely copy backups to a VM
or physical machine operating outside of your deployment.
The operator provisions the backup machine separately from their installation.

To back up your database using SCP:

+ [Create a Public and Private Key Pair](#scp-keys)
+ [Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#configure-scp)

### <a id="scp-keys"></a> Create a Public and Private Key&#8209;Pair

<%= vars.product_short %> accesses a remote host as a user with a private key for authentication.
VMware recommends that this user and key-pair is only used for <%= vars.product_short %>.

1. Determine the remote host that you use to store backups for <%= vars.product_short %>.
   Ensure that the MySQL service instances can access the remote host.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: VMware recommends using a VM outside your deployment
      for the destination of SCP backups. As a result,
      you might need to enable public IPs for the MySQL VMs.
    </p>

1. (Recommended) Create a new user for <%= vars.product_short %> on the destination VM.

1. (Recommended) Create a new public and private key-pair for authenticating as the above user
on the destination VM.

### <a id="configure-scp"></a> Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

Use <%= vars.ops_manager %> to configure <%= vars.product_short %> to back up using SCP.

1. In <%= vars.ops_manager %>, open the <%= vars.product_short %> tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select **SCP**.<br/>

    <img alt="Backup configuration pane shows SCP radio button selected and the fields
     in the pane are described in the table below."
      width="500" src="./images/scp-backups.png"/>

1. Configure the fields as follows:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Instructions</th>
        </tr>

## <a id="ceph-or-s3"></a> Back Up to Amazon S3 or Ceph

When you configure backups for Amazon S3 or Ceph,
<%= vars.product_short %> runs an Amazon S3 client that saves the backups to one of the following:

+ an Amazon S3 bucket
+ a Ceph storage cluster
+ another S3-compatible endpoint certified by VMware

For information about Amazon S3 buckets,
see the [Amazon documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/).
For information about Ceph storage clusters,
see the [Ceph documentation](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/).

To back up your database to Amazon S3 or Ceph:

+ [Create a Custom Policy and Access Key](#access-key-aws)
+ [Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#configure-aws)

### <a id="access-key-aws"></a> Create a Custom Policy and Access Key

<%= vars.product_short %> accesses your S3 bucket through a user account.
VMware recommends that this account is only used by <%= vars.product_short %>.
You must apply a minimal policy that enables the user account upload backups to your S3 bucket.

Give the policy the permission to list and upload to buckets.

The procedure in this section assumes that you are using an Amazon S3 bucket.
If you are using a Ceph or another S3-compatible bucket to create the policy and access key,
follow the documentation for your storage solution.
For more information about Ceph S3 bucket policies,
see the [Ceph documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/bucketpolicy/).

To create a policy and access key in Amazon Web Services (AWS):

1. Create a policy for your <%= vars.product_short %> user account. <br><br>

    In AWS, create a new custom policy by following this procedure in the
    [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-json-editor). <br>

    Paste in the following permissions:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "MySQLBackupPolicy",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
            "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
            "s3:PutObject"
          ],
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::MY_BUCKET_NAME/*",
            "arn:aws:s3:::MY_BUCKET_NAME"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
```

1. Record the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key user credentials for a new user account by
following this procedure in
the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console).
Ensure you select **Programmatic access**
and **Attach existing policies to user directly**. You must attach the policy you created in
the previous step.

### <a id="configure-aws"></a> Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

Use <%= vars.ops_manager %> to connect <%= vars.product_short %> to your S3 account.

**Prerequisite:** Before beginning this procedure,
you must have an S3 bucket in which to store the backups.

1. In <%= vars.ops_manager %>, open the <%= vars.product_short %> tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select **Ceph or Amazon S3**.

    <img alt="Backup configuration pane shows Ceph or Amazon S3 selected and the fields
    in the pane are described in the table below."
    width="400" src="./images/S3-backups.png"/>

1. Configure the fields as follows:

                <strong>Access Key ID</strong> and <strong>Secret Access Key</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
                Enter the S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key that you created in
                <a href="#access-key-aws">Create a Custom Policy and Access Key</a> above.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>Endpoint URL</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
                Enter the S3-compatible endpoint URL for uploading backups. <br>
                The URL must start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. <br>
                The default is <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com</code>.<br>
                If you are using a public S3 endpoint, see the S3 Endpoint procedure in
                <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/aws/config-manual.html#pcfaws-om-dirconfig">Step 3: Director Config Page</a>.

      </table>


## <a id="ip-configure"></a> Back Up to Amazon S3 with Instance Profile
When you configure backups for Amazon S3 with Instance Profile, <%= vars.product_short %> allows the Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role used by BOSH to pass the new backups IAM role to a new EC2 instance.

The procedure in this section allows <%= vars.product_short %> to upload backups to Amazon S3 without Static Credentials (Access and Secret Access Key ID).

<%# For information about Backing Up Amazon EC2 Resources, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/working-with-other-services.html#working-with-ec2). %>

**Prerequisite:** You must be running <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) on AWS

To configure backups for an Amazon S3 with Instance Profile:

* [Create an IAM Role with a Custom Policy](#ip-iam)
* [Add Policy to Existing <%= vars.ops_manager %> User/Role](#ip-configure-ops)
* [Configure VM Extension](#ip-configure-vm)
 * [Create VM Extension in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#ip-vm-ops)
 * [Apply VM extension to dedicated-mysql-broker job of <%= vars.product_short %>](#ip-vm-job)
 * [Set VM extension name in <%= vars.product_short %> tile](#ip-vm-tile)
* [Apply Changes for <%= vars.product_short %> and Upgrade all Service Instances](#ip-apply-upgrade)
* [(Optional) Verify the IAM role is associated with the MySQL Service Instances](#ip-verify-instances)


### <a id="ip-create-policy"></a> Create an IAM Role with a Custom Policy

  <p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Operators must run the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand in this <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.
    This allows the service instances to begin using the instance profile instead of static credentials for backup and restore.<br>
    Static credentials are not provided to existing service instances and backups fail until the service instance is upgraded.
  </p>

The first thing you must do is create a policy for your <%= vars.product_short %> user account.

For more information about AWS identity and access management, see [What is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) in the AWS documentation.
<br><br>
For more information about users, groups, and roles in AWS, see [IAM Identities (users, groups, and roles)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in the AWS documentation.

To create an IAM Role with a custom policy:

1.  In AWS, create an IAM role with a new custom policy by following this procedure in the
    [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-json-editor).
    <br><br>
    Paste in the following permissions:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:ListBucket",
              "s3:ListBucketVersions",
              "s3:ListObjects"
          ],
          "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET-NAME",
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET-NAME/*"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    Where `BUCKET-NAME` is the name of the bucket.

1. Record the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this new IAM role.


### <a id="ip-add-policy"></a> Add Policy to Existing <%= vars.ops_manager %> User/Role
The next thing to do is to add a new policy to the existing <%= vars.ops_manager %> IAM user/role that is described in the **AWS Config** pane of the _BOSH Director for AWS_ tile.
This policy allows the IAM user/role used by BOSH to pass the new backups IAM role to a new EC2 instance.

To find the existing user/role and add a policy:

1. Log into <%= vars.ops_manager %>. To log in, see [Log In to <%= vars.ops_manager %> For the First Time](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/login.html).
1. Click the **BOSH Director for AWS** tile.
1. Select **AWS Config**.

    <img alt="AWS Management Console Config pane shows Amazon S3 (with Instance Profiles) selected."
    width="400" src="./images/aws-config.png"/>

1. Find the existing IAM user/role in the **AWS IAM Instance Profile** field.<br>
For more information about this user/role, see [Step 3: Create an IAM User for <%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/aws/prepare-env-manual.html#create-iam) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> documentation.
1. On the AWS Management Console, add a new policy to that IAM User/Role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowToCreateInstanceWithMySQLBackupstInstanceProfile",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:PassRole",
      "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:iam::540390724081:role/MYSQL-BACKUPS-ROLE"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Where `MYSQL-BACKUPS-ROLE` is the ARN of the role created in the previous section.


### <a id="ip-configure-vm"></a> Configure VM Extension
#### <a id="ip-vm-ops"></a> Create VM Extension in <%= vars.ops_manager %>
There are 2 methods that you can use to create a VM Extension in <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

**Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API directly.**
For more information, see [Create or Update a VM Extension](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/custom-vm-extensions.html#create-vm-extension) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> documentation.

**Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> CLI (om) to create the VM extension.**
For information about `create-vm-extension`, see the [README](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/blob/main/docs/create-vm-extension/README.md) in GitHub.

Example JSON to specify the instance profile name:

```json
{
  "name": "VM-EXTENSION-NAME",
  "cloud_properties": {
    "iam_instance_profile": "INSTANCE-PROFILE-NAME"
  }
}
```
Where:

* `VM-EXTENSION-NAME` is the unique VM extension name that <%= vars.ops_manager %> manages
* `INSTANCE-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the instance profile created in the first step


#### <a id="ip-vm-job"></a> Apply VM extension to `dedicated-mysql-broker` job of <%= vars.product_short %> tile
There are 2 methods that you can use to apply the VM extension to the `dedicated-mysql-broker` job:

**Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API directly.** For more information, see [Apply VM Extensions to a Job](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/custom-vm-extensions.html#apply-vm-extensions) in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> documentation.

**Using the om CLI to configure the tile.** Add the `additional_vm_extensions` key in the `resource-config` section of the product configuration and use the om CLI. For information about configuring using a YAML configuration file, see [om configure-product](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/tree/main/docs/configure-product#configuring-via-yaml-config-file) in GitHub.


#### <a id="ip-vm-tile"></a> Set VM extension name in <%= vars.product_short %> tile
Now that the VM extension has been created and applied, you must set it in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

To set the VM extension name:

1. Log into <%= vars.ops_manager %>. To log in, see [Log In to <%= vars.ops_manager %> For the First Time](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/login.html).
1. Click the **<%= vars.product_short %>** tile.
1. Select **Backups**.
1. Select **Amazon S3 (with Instance Profiles)**

    <img alt="Configure blob store for MySQL backups pane shows Amazon S3 (with Instance Profiles) selected."
    width="400" src="./images/S3-instance-profiles.png"/>
<%# Add "...and the fields in the pane are described in the table below" once we have a table. %>

1. Enter the `VM-EXTENSION-NAME` you created above in the **Instance Profile VM Extension Name** field.
For more information, see [Create VM Extension in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#ip-vm-ops) above.
<%# 1. Configure the fields as follows: %>
1. Click **Save**.


### <a id="ip-apply-upgrade"></a> Apply Changes for <%= vars.product_short %> and Upgrade all Service Instances

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Operators must run the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand in this <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.
  This allows the service instances to begin using the instance profile instead of static credentials for backup and restore.<br>
  Static credentials are not provided to existing service instances and backups fail until the service instance is upgraded.
</p>

### <a id="ip-verify-instances"></a> (Optional) Verify that the IAM role is associated with the MySQL Service Instances
1. On the AWS Management Console, find any EC2 instance that begins with `mysql/GUID`
1. Verify that the IAM Role is present in the details for the instance.


## <a id="gcs"></a> Back Up to GCS

When you configure backups for a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket,
<%= vars.product_short %> runs a GCS SDK that saves backups to a GCS bucket.

  For information about GCS buckets,
  see the [GCS documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).

To back up your database to Google Cloud Storage (GCS):

+ [Create a Service Account and Private Key](#service-account-gcs)
+ [Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#configure-gcs)

### <a id="service-account-gcs"></a> Create a Service Account and Private Key

<%= vars.product_short %> accesses your GCS bucket through a service account.
VMware recommends that this account is only used by <%= vars.product_short %>.
You must apply a minimal policy that enables the service account to upload backups to your GCS bucket.

The service account needs the following permissions:

* List and upload to buckets
* (Optional) Create buckets if they do not already exist

To create a service account and private key in GCS:

1. Create a new service account by following this procedure in
the [GCS documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account). <br>
When you create the service account:
      1. Enter a unique name for the service account name.

## <a id="azure"></a> Back Up to Azure Storage

When you configure backups for Azure Storage,
<%= vars.product_short %> runs an Azure SDK that saves backups to an Azure storage account.

For information about Azure Storage,
see the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).

To back up your database to Azure Storage:

+ [Create a Storage Account and Access Key](#storage-account-azure)
+ [Configure Backups in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#configure-azure)

### <a id="storage-account-azure"></a> Create a Storage Account and Access Key

<%= vars.product_short %> accesses your Azure Storage account through a storage access key.
VMware recommends that this account is only used by <%= vars.product_short %>.
You must apply a minimal policy that enables the storage account upload backups to your Azure Storage.

The storage account needs the following permissions:

* List and upload to buckets
* (Optional) Create buckets if they do not already exist

To create a storage account and access key:

1. Create a new storage account by following this procedure in
the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal#create-a-storage-account).

1. View your access key by following this procedure in
the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage#view-access-keys-and-connection-string)
