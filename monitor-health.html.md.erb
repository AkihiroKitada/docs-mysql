<strong>WARNING! </strong> Highly available cluster plans are currently in beta and are intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
</p>

This topic describes how to obtain the health status for each node 
in a Galera cluster in a highly available cluster plan.

If you cannot write or connect to your app, you should
check the health status of your nodes. You can observe the health status of nodes through a proxy 
using the Switchboard dashboard or API endpoint. You can also view the number of client connections 
routed through a proxy to each node. 
For more information about proxies, see [MySQL Proxy](./proxy.html).

## <a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisite

To connect to Switchboard you need credentials. 

To obtain credentials for accessing the Switchboard dashboard and API, do the following:

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    cf service YOUR-GALERA
    ```
  
    Where `YOUR-GALERA` is the name of your Galera cluster.
  
    <pre class="terminal"> $ cf service myGalera
    Showing info of service myGalera in org acceptance / space example as admin...

    name:         myGalera
    service:      p.mysql
    tags:
    plan:         db-ha-small

1. Record the dashboard hostname, username, and password.

## <a id="dashboard"></a>Monitor Node Health Using the Dashboard

To monitor node health using the Switchboard dashboard, do the following:

1. To view a list of proxies in your browser, navigate to the hostname that you recorded in 
[Prerequisite](#prereq) above. For example, `proxy.123abc45-67d8-912e-34f5-g34612c10dba.org.dedicated-mysql.cf-app.com`

2. When prompted, enter the username and password that you recorded in 
[Prerequisite](#prereq) above.

2. Click the link for the proxy that you want to use to monitor node health.

2. If you are prompted, enter the username and password that you recorded in 
[Prerequisite](#prereq) above.

## <a id="proxy-api"></a> Monitor Node Health Using the API

You can also use the Switchboard API to obtain the information that is shown on the Switchboard dashboard.

For example, you might want to use the API to write your own app to monitor the cluster.

To monitor node health using the Switchboard API, do the following:

1. To monitor node health, run the following command:

    ```
    curl https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@N-HOSTNAME/v0/backends
    ```

    Where:
    + `USERNAME` is the `username` you recorded in [Prerequisite](#prereq) above.
    + `PASSWORD` is the `password` you recorded in [Prerequisite](#prereq) above.
    + `N` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the proxy you want to connect to. 
    + `HOSTNAME` is the `hostname` you recorded in [Prerequisite](#prereq) above.
    
    The above command outputs a JSON object similar to the following: 

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ curl https://abcdefghijklmno:012345678912345@0-proxy.123abc45-67d8-912e-34f5-g34612c10dba.org.dedicated-mysql.cf-app.com/v0/backends

      {
        "host": "a-b1234c5d6.e-f891.bosh",
        "port": 6033,
        "healthy": true,

      }
    ]
    </pre>
