VMware recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v<%= previous_version %>.x
version, upgrade to the latest v<%= previous_version %>.x version
before upgrading to the latest v<%= current_version %>.x version.

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>
+ **Open Beta for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Plans:**
Developers can configure a follower service instance for <%= vars.single_leader_plan_lc %> across foundations.
For more information,
see [Using <%= vars.product_short %> for Multi-Site Replication](./use-multi-site.html).
+ **Backup and Restore <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Service Instances:**
Operators can configure automated backups for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> service instances.
Operators can also use the `mysql-restore` utility to restore
a <%= vars.single_leader_plan %> instance from a backup.
For more information,
see [Backing up <%= vars.product_short %>](./backup.html) and [Restoring <%= vars.product_short %>](./restore.html).

+ **<%= vars.single_leader_plan %> Metrics:** You can view metrics for <%= vars.single_leader_plan %>
service instances in realtime using `cf tail`.

#### Additional New Features
+ **Individual Service Instance Upgrades:**
Developers can upgrade <%= vars.product_short %> service instances individually using the
Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).
For more information about this feature,
see [About Individual Service Instance Upgrades](./upgrade.html#individual-upgrades).
For instructions for individually upgrading service instances,
see [Upgrade a Single Service Instance](./use.html#single).

+ **Telemetry Data:** <%= vars.product_short %> sends Telemetry data when the Telemetry tile is enabled in your foundation.
  For more information about the Telemetry tile,
  see [Telemetry for Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotal-telemetry/).

+ Operators can run the `recreate-all-service-instances` errand to re-create service instance VMs.

#### Feature Improvements
+ **Improved Certificate Rotation Workflow:** <%= vars.product_short %> is compatible with the
<%= vars.ops_manager %> CredHub Maestro certificate rotation feature.
Operators can enable this feature in <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.8 and later.
For more information,
see [CredHub Maestro Rotates BOSH DNS Certificate Authorities](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#maestro-rotate-ca).

+ **Change Highly Available (HA) Cluster Server Defaults:** Developers can set optional parameters
to change MySQL server defaults for HA cluster plans. For instructions for
changing server defaults, see [Changing MySQL Server Defaults](./change-default.html).

+ **Restore HA Clusters with mysql-restore Utility:** Operators can use the `mysql-restore`
utility to restore an HA cluster from a backup.
For more information, see [Restoring <%= vars.product_short %>](./restore.html).

+ An error message appears when developers bind apps to custom schemas with invalid names.
The error message shows the valid characters for custom schema names.

+ Apps no longer timeout when connecting to service instances because of latencies
in BOSH DNS hostname resolution. This issue has been resolved for app and service key
bindings to service instances of all plan types.

### Security Fix

This release includes the following security update:

+ Expired and unused certificates for HA clusters no longer
are stored on HA cluster service instances.
