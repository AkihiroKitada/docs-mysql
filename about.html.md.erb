title: On-Demand Service Architecture

This topic describes the architecture for on-demand MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

For information about architecture of the older, pre-provisioned service, see the [Architecture](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-9/architecture.html) topic for MySQL for PCF v1.9.

## <a id="service-network"></a>BOSH 2.0 and the Service Network

<%= partial '../../mysql/odb/service_networks' %>


## <a id='on-demand'></a>Default Network and Service Network

Like other on-demand PCF services, on-demand MySQL for PCF relies on BOSH 2.0's ability to dynamically deploy VMs in a dedicated network. 
The on-demand service broker uses this capability to create single-tenant service instances in a dedicated service network.

[//]: # (Keep this section in syncy as much as possible with the partial _service_networks_table.html.md.erb)
[//]: # (The custom lines are Leader MySQL VM, Deployed apps on PAS or Elastic Runtime, and Broker and service instances.)

Prior to deploying the MySQL for PCF service tile that uses the on-demand broker (ODB),
the operator must request the network connections needed to allow various components
of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to communicate with ODB.
The specifics of how to open those connections varies for each IaaS.

The following table shows the responsibilities of the key components in an on-demand architecture.

<table class="nice">
	<th>Key Components</th>
	<th>Their Responsibility</th>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH Director</strong></td>
		<td>Creates and updates service instances as instructed by ODB</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH Agent</strong></td>
		<td>BOSH includes an Agent on every VM that it deploys. The Agent listens for instructions from the Director and carries out those instructions. The Agent receives job specifications from the Director and uses them to assign a role, or Job, to the VM.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH UAA</strong></td>
		<td>As an OAuth2 provider, BOSH UAA issues tokens for clients to use when they act on behalf of BOSH users.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>PAS or Elastic Runtime</strong></td>
		<td>Contains the apps that are consuming services</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>ODB</strong></td>
		<td>Instructs BOSH to create and updated services, and connects to services to create bindings</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Deployed service instance</strong></td>
		<td>Runs the given data service (for example, the deployed Redis for PCF service instance runs the Redis for PCF data service)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below. 

<table class="nice">
	<th>This component...</th>
	<th>Must communicate with...</th>
	<th>Default TCP Port</th>
	<th>Communication direction(s)</th>
	<th>Notes</th>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>BOSH Agent</strong></td>
		<td><strong>BOSH Director</strong></td>
		<td>4222</td>
		<td>Two-way</td>
		<td>The BOSH Agent runs on every VM in the system, including the BOSH Director VM.
                    The BOSH Agent initiates the connection with the BOSH Director.<br>

                    for the MySQL service instance.</td>
