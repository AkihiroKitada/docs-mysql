This topic explains how to prepare for upgrading the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service and existing service instances.

## <a id="deprecated-bindings"></a>Overview

MySQL for PCF v2.5 requires service bindings to use BOSH DNS and does not support service bindings that use IP addresses.
But apps that use older versions of the MySQL service may bind to their instances by IP address.

To avoid failure and app downtime when upgrading to MySQL for PCF to v2.5,
all apps that bind to the service by IP address must be re-bound and restarted before you upgrade.

To give developers time to unbind, rebind, and restart their apps,
perform the upgrade procedures on this page well in advance of upgrading the MySQL for PCF tile.

## <a id="check-bindings"></a> Check for Bindings with IP Addresses

To check for running app or service key bindings that use IP addresses, do the following:

1. Run the following command and record the BOSH deployment name for your MySQL service broker:

    ```
  bosh deployments
    ```

1. Run the following command to list current bindings that use IP addresses:

    ```
    bosh -d pivotal-mysql-GUID run-errand find-deprecated-bindings
    ```

    Where `pivotal-mysql-GUID` is the BOSH deployment name for your MySQL service broker.
  <br>
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -d pivotal-mysql-e3ddd36247fe5b923caf run-errand find-deprecated-bindings</pre>

1. Perform the [Remove Deprecated Bindings](#remove-bindings) procedure below
for any apps or service keys that list `no dns` in the `REASON` column of the output table.

## <a id="remove-bindings"></a> Remove Deprecated Bindings

Some of the following steps require coordination with your app developers.
To remove deprecated bindings, do the following:

1. Upgrade your service instances to be compatible with BOSH DNS.
See [Upgrade Service Instance](#upgrade-bindings) below.
1. Replace deprecated service bindings to use BOSH DNS.
See [Replace Deprecated Bindings](#replace-bindings) below.

### <a id="upgrade-bindings"></a> Upgrade Service Instances

To upgrade your service instances, operators must do the following:

1. Notify the developers who own the apps listed by the `find-deprecated-bindings`above
that you will be upgrading all service instances, which can impact app connectivity to the database.
1. Log in to the BOSH Director by following the procedure in
[Log in to the BOSH Director VM](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in).
1. Locate the BOSH deployment name for your MySQL service broker, by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh deployments
    ```
1. Record the BOSH deployment name for the MySQL service broker, which looks like `pivotal-mysql-GUID`.
1. Upgrade all service instances by running the following command:

    ```
    bosh -d pivotal-mysql-GUID run-errand upgrade-all-service-instances
    ```

    Where `pivotal-mysql-GUID` is the value you recorded in the previous step.

1. Notify your developers that, at this time, they will see that apps that do
hostname validation cannot establish a TLS connection to the database.
These apps will output an error similar the following example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    failed to perform TLS handshake with host "10.0.8.5:3306": x509: certificate is valid for 127.0.0.1, not 10.0.8.5
    </pre>

### <a id="replace-bindings"></a> Replace Deprecated Bindings

To replace your deprecated service bindings with new service bindings that use DNS hostnames,
developers must do the following for each binding listed in the log error above:

1. To unbind your app from your service instance, run the following command:

    ```
    cf unbind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```
1. To re-bind your app to your service instance, run the following command:

    ```
    cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE
    ```
1. To restart your app, run the following command:

     ```
     cf restart APP-NAME
     ```

     After you restart all of your apps, your apps can connect to the database and resume service.

1. To ensure that all deprecated service bindings have been replaced, run the following errand:

     ```
     bosh -d pivotal-mysql-GUID run-errand find-deprecated-bindings
     ```

1. Ensure that `no dns` does not appear in the `REASON` column in the output table.
