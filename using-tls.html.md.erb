This topic describes how developers can use TLS to secure the communication
between their apps and the MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2 service.

To use TLS with your apps, the PCF operator must have completed the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html) and enabled TLS in the tile configuration when performing the steps in [Configure Security](install-config.html#security).

The procedures below describe how to [enable TLS](#enable-tls) for your service instances,
and how to [activate TLS for your Java and Spring apps](#activate-apps) to use TLS. If your app is not written in Java or Spring, see [Modifying Apps for TLS](modify-apps-tls.html).

If you want to use the MySQL client to establish a TLS connection to a MySQL for PCF service instance that has TLS enabled, see [Establish a TLS Connection to a Service Instance](use.html#establish-tls).

##<a id='enable-tls'></a> Enable TLS

You cannot automatically configure encryption for a service instance when creating the instance. 
Instead, you must enable TLS encryption for the instance after creating it. You cannot disable TLS 
after it is enabled. 

Perform the following steps to enable TLS for an existing service instance:

1. To create a service key, run the following command:

	```
	cf create-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY
	```

	Where:
	* `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the existing service instance that you want to secure communication to and from.
	* `SERVICE-KEY` is a name for the service key you are creating.    
	
	For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf create-service-key my-service-instance my-service-key</pre>

1. To retrieve the service key credentials, run the following command, specifying the same values as above: 

	```
	cf service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY
	```
	
	In the output, record the value for `hostname`.<br>	   
	For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf service-key my-service-instance my-service-key
	{
 	"hostname": "q-n3s3y1.q-g31.bosh",
 	"jdbcUrl":    "jdbc:mysql<span>:</span>//10.1.16.3:3306/service\_instance\_db?user=6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c\u0026password=a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa\u0026",
 	"name": "service\_instance\_db",
 	"password": "a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa",
 	"port": 3306,
 	"uri": "mysql<span>://</span>6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c:a22aaa2a2a2aaaaa<span>@</span>10.244.16.3:3306/service\_instance\_db?reconnect=true",
 	"username": "6bf07ae455a14064a9073cec8696366c"
	}
	</pre>
	
1. To update the existing service instance to enable TLS, run the following command:

	```
	cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE -c '{"enable_tls": ["HOSTNAME"]}'
	```
	
	Where:
	* `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of the existing service instance that you want to secure communication to and from.
	* `HOSTNAME` is the value for `hostname`. 

	For example:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf update-service my-service-instance -c '{"enable_tls": ["q-n3s3y1.q-g31.bosh"]}'
	</pre>
	If you receive the following error message, the operator has not enabled TLS.
    See the procedures in [Preparing for TLS](prepare-tls.html) and [Configure Security](install-config.html#security).
	<pre class="terminal">TLS has not been enabled in the service offering. Speak with your Operator to make this available.</pre>

1. To check the status of the operation, run `cf services` and locate your service instance.    
   <br>
	 For example:   
	
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf services
	Getting services in org example / space development as admin...
	OK
	<br>
	name                  service   plan       bound apps   last operation
	my-service-instance   p.mysql   db-small                update in progress
	</pre>
	When the operation has completed, `update succeeded` appears under `last operation`.

1. To delete the service key, run the following, specifying the same values as above: 
 
	```
	cf delete-service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE SERVICE-KEY
	```
	
	For example:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf delete-service-key my-service-instance my-service-key
	</pre>

##<a id='activate-apps'></a> Activate TLS for Java and Spring Apps

For your apps to use TLS, you must update them to request encrypted communications when connecting to the MySQL data service. 

The procedure for updating your app depends on the app's language and framework.

Java and Spring apps automatically detect TLS, while apps written in other languages and frameworks must be manually modified to use TLS:

* If your app is written in Java or Spring, perform the procedure below.
* If your app is not written in Java or Spring, see [Modifying Apps for TLS](modify-apps-tls.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Any apps using an existing service instance must be rebound after enabling TLS for the instance.</p>

To activate TLS for Java and Spring apps, you must stop and rebind the app to the service instance after enabling TLS on the instance. 
Perform the following steps:

1. Stop the app. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf stop my-app</pre>
1. Unbind the app from the service instance. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf unbind-service my-app my-service-instance</pre>
1. Re-bind the app to the service instance. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf bind-service my-app my-service-instance</pre>
1. Restage the app. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf restage my-app</pre>

Your app should now communicate securely with the MySQL service instance.
