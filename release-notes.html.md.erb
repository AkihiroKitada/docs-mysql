<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v2.4.x version, upgrade to the latest v2.4.x version
before upgrading to the latest v2.5.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths, see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Before Upgrading: </strong> All bindings created using MySQL for PCF v2.3 or earlier use IP addresses. Any bindings created using v2.3 or earlier <strong>must be re-created</strong> before upgrading to v2.5, which requires DNS-based bindings. For more information, see <a href="errands.html#find-deprecated-bindings">MySQL for PCF Errands</a>.</p>


## <a id="252"></a>v2.5.2

**Release Date:**  December 19, 2018

#### Bindings Use DNS

This release completes the transition from bindings via IP addresses to DNS hostnames. This lays the foundation for coming improvements, and also enables Highly Available Clusters (HA Clusters).

#### Developers can Monitor Service Instances
Developers can see metrics for their service instances via the [CF CLI Log Cache plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache-cli). For more information about metrics that MySQL for PCF emits, see [Monitoring and KPIs](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/monitor.html).

### **Highly Available Option**

MySQL for PCF now supports **three deployment topologies**. In addition to Single Node and Leader-Follower, Operators can now offer a Highly Available Cluster service plan. For information on how to configure a HA Cluster plan, see [Configure Service Plans](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html#active). For information on availability criteria for each topology, see [Availability Options](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/availability-options.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING! </strong> Highly available clusters are <strong>beta</strong> in MySQL for PCF v2.5.</p>

Features of HA clusters include:

- Like Single Node and Leader-Follower, multiple deployments of HA clusters can be provisioned on demand.
- Developers can view a dashboard to see the state of each node in an HA cluster. For more information, see [Monitor Node Health Using the Dashboard](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/monitor-health.html#dashboard).
- Connections to HA clusters are secured via TLS.
- Monitoring, diagnostics, and backups are performed from a **jumpbox VM**. For information on how to configure this VM, see [Configure Service Plans](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html#active).
	- The jumpbox VM runs a replication canary that continuously tests replication health of cluster nodes. For more information, see [Replication Canary](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/monitor.html#repcanary).
	- Operators can run diagnostics (e.g., disk usage) on an HA cluster by running `mysql-diag` on the jumpbox VM. For more information, see [Running mysql-diag](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/mysql-diag.html).
	- Like Single Node and Leader-Follower, configuring automatic backups is required. For information on how to configure automated backups, see [Configure Backups](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/install-config.html#backups). For instructions to perform a manual backup and restore, see [Backing Up and Restoring On-Demand MySQL for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/2-5/backup-and-restore.html).

While in **beta**, the following limitations exist:

- Operators are required to impose a plan quota of no more than five instances.
- Restoring from backups is a manual process. For more information, see [Restore an HA Cluster Instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/backup-and-restore.html#runHA).
- HA clusters cannot integrate with [Vormetric Transparent Encryption for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/vormetric-transparent-encryption/).

#### Highly Available clusters are for advanced use cases only

In addition to higher infrastructure cost, HA clusters introduce some significant limitations that are different from running Single-Node or Leader-Follower. For more information, see [High Availability Limitations](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/index.html#limitations).

Due to these limitations, HA Clusters are **not recommended for sharing between multiple users or applications**. Service instance sharing is **disabled** for HA Clusters. If necessary, you can still share by creating User Provided Service Instances (UPSI). For more information, see [User Provided Service Instances](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html).

Choose HA Clusters only when the availability criteria that Leader-Follower provides is not sufficient for your application.

#### Connections Secured by Default

Connections to the database over TLS are enabled by default for each service instance. It is no longer necessary for developers to perform manual steps to enable TLS. TLS can be optionally disabled by the Operator.

#### Improvements for Operators
- Operators can configure up to nine service plans in the tile.
- Operators can mark service plans as **free** or **paid** so that developers can be aware of costs associated with certain service plans.
- Operators can configure the default idle timeout for connections to a service instance, which prevents applications from overloading the database with unnecessary connections.
